We’ve had a Discord channel for a while, and now you can find us in the fediverse too. 

The site is built with software called Lemmy and looks much the same as Reddit. It even uses the r/subreddit naming conventions for different sections, just swapping out ‘r’ and using ‘c’ instead. The biggest difference is that alongside subscribing to these sections (subreddit equivalents) on our site, you can also subscribe to them on other fediverse sites, and their content will show up on your front page on our site, alongside our content.

Nothing will change on the r/futurology subreddit, this new site will be an extension of its existing community. We expect over time the site will be a mixture of people from the subreddit and brand new people who find us within the fediverse network.

Something I should have mentioned originally is the goal with this tech is not to be a ""rich-people-exclusive"" transportation method. EHang has said they hope to eventually get the cost of riding to be around the cost of an Uber X.

Please stop repeating the same negativity. The fact that someone was able to create a *working* autonomous aerial vehicle is a technological advancement whether you think it's a good idea or not.

This person on YouTube created a robot that plays the original Tomb Raider games from the 90's by itself. It's so AI that it even surpasses human intelligence (trust me, you should see my friend or even my sister play those games).

But, here's where this remarkable achievement in AI really shines. It was created using only ""multiple free AI"". These are the words used of it's very own creator, FoxMaster, on YouTube (check description). Here is the link to the video which not only covers how this incredible AI came to be but also a complete demonstration of it in action: [https://youtu.be/0wTf\_bbkW2U?si=LZ16KLLzAVa0KNcm](https://youtu.be/0wTf_bbkW2U?si=LZ16KLLzAVa0KNcm)

Already at half a million views in just under 2 months!! I'm not really sure what ""multiple free AI"" means either, but after watching the video it's basically just Google image search, chatGPT, and the free audio program Audacity. That's pretty much it! No other coding or originally implemented software used! That's totally possible, right?

I'm no AI or robotics expert myself but I'm hoping that someone who sees this is and could provide some commentary. Like I said before after witnessing my friend and my sister try and play these old Tomb Raider games, this robot is genius level.

Not only that, but using only chatGPT, the creator has given the AI a whole personality that perfectly mirrors the character's original personality in the game (Lara Croft) just by simply inputting a short list of character attributes.

This couldn't possibly be a hoax.. could it? Like, could it just be simple pre-recorded gameplay with a text-to-speech voiceover only using AI to make it sound like the character's voice but the actual words typed by the creator himself/herself?

172059c,hot,Predicting the Arrival of AGI: A Study Underscores Its Imminent Existential Risk to Humanity,"A recent study employs economic modelling techniques to forecast the expected arrival date of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The paper projects an average arrival date of 2041, with a likely range between 2032 and 2048. The estimated earliest arrival is shockingly close—2028, a mere five years from now.

The paper also posits that humanity will come “reasonably close” to AGI by 2034, with the earliest projection being 2026—just three years away. These predictions come with a caveat that significant global conflict could delay AGI’s arrival by up to 10 years.

The study supports recent warnings about the existential risks of AGI from leading figures in the AI field like Hinton, Hassibis, and Bengio. It counters arguments from philosophers who consider the existential risks of AGI to be overblown.

Importantly, the paper suggests that the advent of AGI could very likely precede any catastrophic impacts from global warming. This leads to the sobering conclusion that AGI should be considered the most pressing existential risk facing humanity today.

Given the proximity of these timelines, immediate global action is imperative to address the challenges and risks that AGI poses to our existence.",Futurology,0.71,2023-10-07 03:20:01

>Well, the types of computers we have today are tools. They’re responders: you ask a computer to do something and it will do it. The next stage is going to be computers as “agents.” In other words, it will be as if there’s a little person inside that box who starts to anticipate what you want. Rather than help you, it will start to guide you through large amounts of information. It will almost be like you have a little friend inside that box.

Among other functions, hydrogen is a fuel and an input for the refining, metallurgy and pharmaceuticals industries. Global food systems also depend on fertilizer produced with hydrogen.

Hydrogen extracted from natural gas has been the primary driver of all this activity, with coal also factoring in to a lesser extent.

That is about to change as the falling cost of wind, solar, and other renewables has flipped the script on electrolysis, a known technology for pushing hydrogen gas from plain water with an electrical current.

The result is green hydrogen, a new global industry that has been drawing investor interest like honey to flies.

In contrast, so-named blue hydrogen is a public relations gimmick aimed at enabling fossil energy stakeholders to go about their business even as the planet burns.

Blue hydrogen simply refers to the same old fossil-sourced hydrogen, tricked out with carbon capture systems. It does not address the plethora of environmental issues related to natural gas extraction — including the impact on water resources — while adding another layer of impacts. Here in the US, blue hydrogen proposals have already sparked protests over new pipelines and sequestration sites, and there’s plenty more where that comes from.""",Futurology,0.76,2023-10-03 05:56:22

16wxl7i,hot,"If you were to create a new system of distance measurement (to replace millimeters), what would you base it off, and why?","I've grown up with the metric system, but millimeters still feel arbitrary. They're not bad, but I wonder what we could have used instead.  
  
For example, in a hypothetical new system, maybe instead of 1 millimeter, the equivalent measurement could be 1/3 of a millimeter. This would give a little more granularity to commonly measured things. The equivalent of a meter in this new system would be 333.33 millimeters (33.33 centimeters), which is similar in length to an American foot or a Japanese shaku. Instead of walking at 4 or 5 kilometers per hour, you'd be walking at 12 or 15 \[1/3 of a kilometer\]s per hour.  
  
I've never in my life used the exact measurement of 1 millimeter for anything. It's too thick for paper or pencil tips. Too big for tiny insects. Yet it's too small for easy estimation. Nobody ever sees a thin tree branch and estimates that it's 13mm. We only use it because it's standard. We can measure with it (you can measure with anything if it's standardized), but I've never known anyone to estimate things in millimeters.  
  
If I need to estimate a small size, I can approximate 1 centimeter or 1 inch with my finger and thumb. I can approximate 30 centimeters out in front of me. I can even approximate 1 millimeter. I can't approximate 1 meter (if I try, it's closer to 90 cm, and I have never ever used the American/Imperial Yard. It's just that 3 x 30cm is just easier to approximate than 100cm is.).  
  
Art supplies deal with pen tips that are fractions of 1 millimeter. Sheetmetal can be in the realm of a few millimeters, or less than a millimeter. Glass beakers are probably a few millimeters thick. Even drill bits can be as precise as 6 decimal places smaller than a millimeter. 3D printing needs precision tighter than 1 millimeter.  
  
And to clarify: Why am I targeting the millimeter specifically? Because I believe it is the most important measurement in metric. It's the most accessible and useful. I feel as if the Micrometer and the Meter are functionally based on the Millimeter (even if that's not the order of how it happened).  
  
So, are there any things in your field of expertise that you'd want to be the basis of a hypothetical measurement system?",Futurology,0.24,2023-10-01 06:25:16

Eor example, if we ever figure out how to manipulate the enviorment around us (synthetic biology), make travel possible (faster on earth and interstellar) and find ways to extend the human lifespan, then would be imagining a future where we all live virtual lives and such? I read current tech developments and it seems like alot of work is being done in both digital and physical spaces and my favorites are the ones that combine both (synthetic biology, self-driving cars, fusion, etc). Especially because the digital cannot exist without the physical. I do think the line between the digital and physical world will continue to blur but I am trying to figure out by how much? Will it go to an extreme or will it be a balance of the both by 2100? What do you think? I kind of hope we have a marvel like future where the digital world is consistenly there but the physical world stays too. ",Futurology,0.41,2023-09-28 19:42:11

As amazing as it is, there's always gonna be limits like amount of zooming before an image gets blurry, or amount of slowing down before a video gets choppy. So say if we want a video that, just like real life, has infinite frames per sec, what could we do to achieve that? Even further what if we want a total playback of reality like Tony Stark's Barf, what kind of technology do we use without also using infinite amount of storage? 

My first thought is to just capture the general information about specific events, then use AI to 'upscale' or 'updetail' them, but that would just be like adding extra post generated frames to videos to make them smoother...

16rrp37,hot,What is the term for an emergent superintelligence that arises when minds are linked together or otherwise engaged in a unifying effort?,"It's not a hive mind as that is fundamentally different. A hive mind is a lateral expansion where each individual mind operates in a parallel capacity so that complex tasks can be piecemealed across each computational cluster. A hive mind capitalizes on redundancy rather than complexity.

This superintelligence would emerge unintentionally and isn't likely to be recognizable at first as it would be the result of being more than the sum of its own complex components. It would be analogous to how an individual neuron in a human brain is unaware of conscious self-awareness but the combination of many neurons allows consciousness and intelligence to emerge. That's a bit reductive as there are numerous components (eg, semiotics, cerebral and prefrontal cortices, etc) which are responsible for the gestalt of conscious self-awareness, but I digress.

An example of this would be similar to the rudimentary superintelligences found in The Electric State by Simon Stalenhag. In the story, people were using a neural link headset (neurocaster) to interact with a vast internetwork but in many cases, people would lose themselves in it, refusing to unplug, resulting in death from malnutrition, sleep deprivation, or a lack of self-preservation in the face of dangers. Individuals lost autonomy and regressed to acting as a single cell, collectively becoming part of the tissue of the neurocaster network where individuation gave rise to a far more complex entity, one whose machinations couldn't be understood or easily recognized by any individual ""cell"", if that makes sense.

I remember reading something years ago that speculated that the internet itself may one day evolve to a point of being considered an autonomous intelligence, though neither conscious nor self-aware, in a similar way and through similar means.",Futurology,0.77,2023-09-25 09:12:41

16nk2j1,hot,The big problem with moving to clean zero-emission vehicles: poorer countries must not be left behind,"Over the years we have seen the increasing adoption of zero-emission vehicles. EVs had been around for a while and have been finally taking off in recent years, since 2017 or so, and growing faster than ever before. We've also got hydrogen, which have not achieved much penetration yet but I personally think it will eventually take off as well in a few years' time.

This is all good news and vital for a greener future. But there is a huge caveat: we cannot just expect to 'change the world' with moving to zero-emission cars on the streets of New York, Paris and Vienna.

We need this in Lagos, in Rio, in Dhaka, in Bangkok... we need the green revolution to take place in the developing or 2nd world nations. In the cities listed above for example, air pollution is very high and traffic congestion is crazy. Their populations are growing fast, as is a common theme throughout the 2nd and 3rd world.

In countries like China or Bangladesh, millions of people have been lifted out of poverty over the decades, which is good for them. But it also means that those people would 'level up' and start driving cars (instead of motorcycles or no vehicle), leading to more pollution. Combining that with rapid urban growth has been a recipe for disaster, as you can see for example in this [picture](https://nilepost.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/air.jpg) of Kampala, Uganda. So this is a cyclic problem that will keep getting worse.

The other issue is to do with EVs - they will not be as reliable in many countries that are already lacking in other infrastructure. There are often power cuts in many places, take Beirut for example, where EVs are an absolute no-no in its current state. Hydrogen would probably be best suited for these places, but it hasn't taken off anywhere yet.

I am writing this because I think this point is vital for our vision of a greener future. Zero-emission vehicles are beautifully clean, green and quiet, and really good for the world's future. But we can't get there without some serious investment in the poorer countries. If we don't do this I fear that the green car revolution will not happen at all on a global basis.",Futurology,0.76,2023-09-20 08:29:36

16nuj17,hot,The future is already happening,"The Copenhagen interpretation says the probability waves exist for a particle then the particle is observed which then demonstrates what it collapses as as being the actual state and the other probability waves were not the actual state and therefore no longer exist and therefore assumes what physically collapses as being exclusively ‘real’. In the many worlds interpretation it says that regardless of what collapses, potential already and always does exist.   
  
With this comes the implication that the future has already ‘happened’ in the sense that the possibilities already exist and what collapses isn’t exclusively real and that the potential is as equally ‘happening’ as what collapses (the future is already happening/ whatever can appear is always already happening). Just as the potential that appeared in the 'past', it’s not the past happened and now it’s not happening, those waves are not currently being collapsed but they still exist or are still happening so take a video for instance, you’re not watching something that has happened it’s currently happening and is always happening.  
  
If the past is not set and is still happening it can still be influenced – so take a video filmed in the past, if you had the ability of telekinesis, you could lift something up in the video and that would be what ‘happened’ in the past. If you had that ability you could influence the past and furthermore you could influence/ change the past in the future (could do something, in this case watch the video, in the future and change the past). Let’s say there is a video of an object being lifted into the air by telekinesis filmed 30 years ago, and let’s say that the person with telekinesis abilities is called person A, let’s also say I watch the video of the object being lifted but person A hasn’t watched the video and lifted the object yet and he is going to do it in the future say 15 minutes from now – something in the past has already happened because of something in the future that hasn’t happened yet.  
  
Question – let’s say we stop person A from ever watching the video such as delete the video, now he can’t lift the object in the past so the object lifting couldn’t have happened.  
There wouldn’t have been the video of the object being lifted because it only happened because person A lifted it in the future.  
  
Question – so let’s say person A did watch the video and lift the object 15 minutes from now – I can watch the video now of it being lifted even though person A hasn’t done it yet?   
Only if person A actually does/ did do it in the future – if not the object would not have lifted.  
  
Question – so the future has already happened?  
If the object was lifted then that means person A did lift the object in the future.  
  
Question - so the future is set?   
If the object was lifted that means that it did already happen even though person A hasn’t done it yet but even though the object being lifted has already happened/ appeared, the decision to do it hasn’t appeared yet because the past is only influenced when person A watches the video and lifts the object - only at the ‘time’ (point) when the decision to change the past is made is the past changed otherwise it wouldn’t of happened (past changes on a whim so to speak (not fixed)/ it’s not that the object was lifted in the past then the future is already set and person A lifting the object has already happened (is set). The object isn’t lifted until the point in the future when person A decided to do it, so it’s not that the future is set it’s because the past isn’t set, the past is still happening and so the past isn’t changed/ it’s not person A ‘changes the past’ (that the object wasn’t originally lifted then person A lifts it instead and changes something that already happened), the object being lifted is what ‘originally’ happened or the object lifting is just what is happening - there's no time between the object lifting ‘in the past’ and person A lifting it ‘in the future’/ person A ‘in the future’ lifting the object ‘in the past’ is happening in ‘real-time’.  
  
The potential for anything to collapse is always already happening. There are infinite configurations that are always happening and just one configuration even though is currently collapsed/ appearing is never set – it’s always everything.  
  
In that sense, the future is already happening but you can’t precisely predict the future (clairvoyance) you can just be aware of/ imagine the ways the particles can be configured eg. if there are dark clouds you could say there is going to be lightning but you can’t say when or where the lightning will hit but the lightning strike has already happened/ is already happening.",Futurology,0.52,2023-09-20 15:45:50

Most developed countries suffer from this, take a look at Japan for example. (The US and Germany, France benefit from migration)

16o66a9,hot,How long before we stop making babies the old fashioned way?,"How long before it becomes barbaric to allow a pregnancy that originated from standard sex? Will we reach a point in knowledge and control of genetics that we will say it is immoral to not carefully engineer the DNA of a fetus? If we could guarantee through artificial manipulation that we could eliminate 90% of genetic problems and could avoid most diseases, that option would look really good.

It occurs to me that such a question will edge towards eugenics. So I ask that people be mindful of that. We are already pre-screening for certain health reasons. We are already using genetic analysis in certain places in at risk couples. It just seems like we will get better at this and will keep finding places where parents will avoid genetic problems that they know run in their family, or that their children will be susceptible to a certain gene. 

If certain diseases or genetic problems go to zero in the cohort that are doing genetic screening, and it stays at, say, 5% for the other group, people in the 5% are going to complain. They may come to realize that the genetic screening  is the best route.

That could be our first future. It may eventually lead to this. 

As knowledge of genetics gets deeper, we may start doing significant gene editing to avoid certain diseases. We can build ""vaccines"" into our DNA. Again, the most forward leaning may take that plunge, and get some disease down to 0%. Screening won't be good enough. We need to do genetic manipulation. 

This could lead to a world where people trying to have sex and then pre-screening would be looked down upon by allowing for an unacceptable construction of a genome. Our genomes must be genetically sculpted to avoid all sorts of health problems that we can control. 

So, how long before we stop making babies the old fashioned way?",Futurology,0.4,2023-09-21 00:18:24

16knr9r,hot,Is the progress of technology creating a snowball effect that we can no longer control in the future?,"**TL;DR**

Progress of technology speeds up over time while becoming more complex, we still have big problems with older technology, like climate change, nuclear power struggles and mechanics around misinformation.

So the question arises if something like AI, or any other new complex technology, will make it spin out of control.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex technology is build on other layers of technology .

A good example is the car. It is build on various other inventions, like the wheel, the engine but also the **r**oad system.

It created an enormous amount of options for progress. More rapid exchange of materials, people, food, medicin, books.

But if we look at the road system,  when the car became in use a lot of traffic accidents happened early on since there were no traffic signs, lanes, driver licenses, sidewalks and so on. The road system invented by the romans was build for slower traffic.

The road system was adapted but traffic accidents are still the number one cause of death today for young people, the engine (and this not the main point of my post) is a source of climate change. The transport system created problems that we are still trying to solve today.

If we look at the internet as a road system, traffic was slower as well, and not as networked. There was a barrier for technology to set up services, and there was a user barrier.

The use of the internet created its own set of problems but it also progressed much more rapidly, just like the engine created much more rapid progress than the wheel and the road system, and all technologies before that.

That's because building layer on layer upon technology creates much more morefull technology, which in turn speeds up progress of new technology, this while it is getting more complex.

So the point is if we come to the point of powerfull technology like AI, and we still struggling with big problems of more basic layers of technology, like climate change, nuclear power struggles and group mechanics around misinformation,

this while technology becoming more complex and increasing more rapidly, isn't it going to turn into a snowball effect we can no longer control?

16klims,hot,Post-AI Economy & Job Satisfaction,"One theory as it relates to AI job replacement is that automation will eliminate the need for humans to work menial ""shit jobs"", most of which are found in consumer-driven/retail industries such as food, entertainment, or information processing. This might be merely a rationalization for profit-driven entities to lay off their employees, but it is nonetheless a talking point.

However, once these jobs are largely replaced, that does not solve the problem of how people will find a sufficient number of jobs that might be more (subjectively) ""meaningful"". Therefore, a new paradigm shift might need to take place with respect to how our economic system is re-composed of employment deriving from other sectors.

What would this look like? My initial idea is a transition to a state capitalist system where the government, though policy and investment, forcibly shifts the industries that dominate our GDP to large-scale projects that greatly increase the demand in areas like energy, manufacturing, resource extraction, or construction, all of which are (to an extent) more insulated from current developments in AI that threaten replacement. If left solely to the market, I don't see how this transition could take place in a reasonable amount of time before mass discontent spreads.

This doesn't guarantee job satisfaction, but employees in these burgeoning sectors can at least take solace in the fact that each of them are contributing to projects (e.g. space or mega-housing) which are serving a collective good. Added to this is the fact that these jobs would require training in specialized skill sets which would give each prospective employee a greater sense of having put their mental faculties to better use.

What are your thoughts or proposals? They should meet the two requirements of (1) employing at least the same number of people being actively displaced by AI and (2) creating jobs that give a greater sense of satisfaction than the menial service positions currently still filled by humans. Should the government play a role or do you think market forces will sufficiently reorient the workforce in a timely fashion?",Futurology,0.56,2023-09-16 19:29:41

16k74gp,hot,What interplanetary wars might look like in the future,"So we know that planets like Mars have lots of uranium, and if we assume that the solar system is being colonized, and cities and societies are being created that do not rely on Earth for support, then this could be a fun speculation. 

For instance, we might have cities on Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Callisto, Titan, Europa, Mars, the moon, Venus and more. Certain countries on Earth like South Korea, China, the US, Russia and more would back their corresponding countries on other planets, moons, and dwarf planets with some being backed by larger players like Mars in a fight for resources.

The fourth or fifth cold war might be an interplanetary one. With these ground rules established, what would a solar system wide war look like potentially hundreds of years into the future?

Well, for starters, the major factor is distance. Earth to Mars is 6 months, Jupiter is about 5 years, Pluto is 10 years away. Other significant places like the moon and Venus are several months away by rocket and other destinations like Ceres are 1-2 years away. 

So of course, it doesn't really make sense...unless all these factions have come *prepared* for a war. 

If there's an interplanetary cold war, various places would send nuclear warheads in distant orbits around other celestial destinations. If something happens, they can press a red button, and the nuclear warhead ""unexpectedly"" collides in a target zone. Mars nukes could be ready to fire at New York City or Seöul, while the same is for *the twin cities of Spirit and Opportunity, Mars' beating heart* or the capital, *Star City*. Even areas that take 6 years to reach or more like Titan will have sent nuclear warheads to Earth, Mars, Venus, and more. Plus, the warheads in orbit around major destinations like Earth are not necessarily against Earth collectively. They could be Chinese-backed celestial destinations like Ceres sending warheads to target the USA, or American backed territories on Mars sending warheads to orbit Earth, ready to strike *New Shàng'hǎï* at a moments notice.

I would say every celestial destination would have several hundred war heads around it. A ""regular"" such destination like Ceres would have many warheads around it by various places, all trained on Vallis Aeternum, while Ceres itself has sent its warheads to a bunch of places 3 times over due to major players claiming territories, namely the *People's Republic of Mars*, China, and the USA.

Sorry, it’s long. TLDR at the bottom. 

So I was quite intrigued a few months ago watching the Mr Who’s the Boss video about AirTags, where he explains that they talk to other Apple devices rather than transmit their own long distance signals.
I’m making an assumption therefore that all Apple devices talk to each other, and that there is a record somewhere in the phone or Apples servers that these phones interacted. 
Also assuming that people always have their mics on(let’s say they have “hey siri” on), surely this means that in our modern age, there’s a record of most petty crime being committed.
For example, if a robber robs you at gun point, there’s a record on both your phones that they were together, and that both phones recorded “give me your money or I shoot”.
I find this interesting, as it provides pretty solid evidence of soemthing happening, but at the same time is only partially good at creating an alibi, as that evidence could be faked by the robber just leaving their phone at home. 
Max tegmarks book Life 3.0 touches on this, where he asks whether humans would be willing to be survailed by the state, if tech gets good enough to deepfake us committing a crime.
Our governments already tap into our search history and phones, idk about places other than the UK and ISA, but the PATRIOT act is Orwellian, why don’t we at least use this data to help people?
So my question is: if big tech was storing our locations and mic/camera data for improvements, how come we don’t use them to track petty crime? Heck at this point, we could track insider trading, drug deals and everything else?

TLDR: why doesn’t the data recorded by big tech for improvements (ie location, mic and camera data), why aren’t they then used by governments to track crime?",Futurology,0.73,2023-09-13 16:14:12

Can it scale up thou?

It's clear that trying to do that is problematic when you consider the funding required at that level.

You can print money to pay people but then you cause inflation severe enough to make it enormously self defeating.

Or you can redistribute money, but to do so you'd need absurdly punitive taxes on the most productive people, thereby destroying productivity and putting your economy on a slow death march, especially if it has to compete against an unrestrained free market in another country.

However, however, however.  If you reframe the conversation and take money out of the discussion it becomes more possible.  Instead - you provide comprehensive access to goods and services at ultra low cost accessible to everyone, not just the impoverished.

To some extent, we do this already.  City water fountains are free, the ER can't turn you away, 911 doesn't charge you a fee to come, and you can send your kid to public school and there's no tuition bill.  I'm sure there are others.

But what if this also applied to food?  You walk into a grocery store, take what you want, and walk out.  No paying money.  You just get your food and go.  Then scale it up to clothes, to health vision and dental, even housing and utilities.  Robots and AI make it theoretically possible (a real life version of the Star Trek Replicator) to do without absurdly high taxes

Supposing you could do this, you still hurt the producers and workers in those markets.  You could make compromises and say gourmet food and luxury fashion still costs money while the necessities are free or almost free, but the impact on production would still be highly negative.

Still though, if suddenly people don't have bills and have all their basic needs just magically met, everyone can just focus on the top part of Maslow's pyramid, and maybe that's not such a bad trade off.

""Wave"" is not the right word here. The proper term is ""tsunami"". And by tsunami, I mean the kind of tsunami you saw when that asteroid hit the Earth in the motion picture, ""Deep Impact"". Remember that scene where the beach break was vastly and breathtakingly drawn out in seconds? That is the point where humanity is at *this very moment* in our AI development. And the scene where all the buildings of NYC get knocked over *by* that impact tsunami, a very short time later, is going to be the perfect metaphor for what happens to human affairs when that AI ""tsunami"" impacts *us*.

Here is the scene from that movie in case you forgot, or dint see it. Wow! World Trade Center... This movie is already so *old* (1998) Stupid passage of time!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNtsVP42bOE

 It may not be survivable. 

 We are on the very verge of developing *true* artificial general intelligence. Something that does not exist now and has not ever existed in human recorded history up to this point.  So if you want to vet the things that I am telling you, I'll provide some links. But we'll come to that. First, I want to explain what is *actually* going on.

 As you know, in the last not quite one year since 30 Nov 22, when GPT 3.5, better known as ChatGPT was released, the world has changed astonishingly. People can't seem to agree over how long ChatGPT took to penetrate human society. I will, for argument's sake, say it took 15 days for ChatGPT from OpenAI, to be downloaded by 100 _million_ humans. But I have reason to believe the actual time was *five* days.

And then on 14 Mar 23, GPT-4 was also released by OpenAI.

Some things about GPT-4. When GPT-4 was still in its pre-release phase, there was a lot of speculation about just how powerful it would be compared to GPT 3.5. The number was stated to be roughly 100 *trillion* parameters. The number of parameters in ChatGPT is 175 billion. Shortly after that number was published, that ""100 trillion"" one, a strange thing happened. OpenAI said, well no, it's not going to be 100 trillion. In fact, it may not be much more than 175 billion even. (It was still pretty big though, 1.7 *trillion* parameters.) This is because there had been another breakthrough in which parameters were not going to matter so much as a different metric. The new metric that was far more accurate to how the LLM model would perform was released. It was called ""tokens"". That is the, like, individual letter, word, punctuation or symbol, or whatever is input and then output. And is based on the training data required for a given LLM. It is what enables an LLM to ""predict the next word or sequence"". Like in the case of coding. (I'm not even going to address ""recursive AI development"" here. I think it will become pretty obvious in a short time.) 

The number of tokens for GPT-4 is potentially 32K. The number of tokens for ChatGPT is 4,096. That is an approximately 8x increase over ChatGPT. But just saying it is 8x more is not the whole picture. That 8x increase allows for the combination of those tokens in a manner which is probably an astronomical increase. Let me give you an analogy to better understand what that means for LLMs. So there are 12 notes of music and there are about 4,017 known chords. Of them, only *four* really matter. That combination of notes and them 4 chords are pretty much what has made up music since the earliest music has existed. And there is likely a near infinite number of musical re-arrangements of those chords still in store.

 That is what 'tokens' mean for LLMs.

And here is where it gets ""interesting"". Because that 8x increase allows for the ability to do some things that LLMs have never been able to do previously. They call it ""emergent"" capabilities. And ""emergent"" capabilities can be, conservatively speaking, *startling*. Startling emergent capabilities have even been seen in ChatGPT but particularly in generative AI image generating models like ""Midjourney"" or ""Stable Diffusion"" for instance. And now it is video. Have you seen an AI generated video yet? They are a helluva thing. Here is a sample if you haven't seen one. This is a video based entirely on prompts. The AI produced *all* of the imagery.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDV1HGbrc&list=FLRaQyjJEBTXrO4ffE6jfVZg&index=67&t=2s

So basically, an emergent capability is a new ability that was never initially trained into the algorithm that spontaneously came into being. (And we don't know *why*) You can find many examples of this online. Not hard to find. All of that is based on what we call the ""black box"". That is, why a given AI zigs instead of zags in its neural network node ""weights"", but still (mostly) gives us the right answer. Today we call the wrong answer ""hallucinating"". That kind of error is going to go away fairly soon. But the ""black box"" is going to be vast, *vast* and impenetrable. Probably already is.

In late November of 2022, an interesting, albeit rather obscure, paper was published.
""Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks""

https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12588 (Abstract only)

This paper was published before GPT-3.5 was released. And it actually concerns the ""cognitive reasoning"" potential of an unrelated AI language model, ""Codex"".  Still the concept of the paper is a bit of a departure from what had been. ""Chain of Thought"" (COT) and ""Program of Thought"" (POT) are two *way* different things. COT is what the model *does*. POT is how the model arrives at the outcome. Crudely it can be described as its ""thought process"". ""Few-shot"" or possibly ""zero-shot"" analogy. Yes, that sounds ""fuzzy"", because it *is*. It has huge implications. Something unsettling is beginning. We'll come back to that ""zero-shot"" business in a moment.
Very shortly after GPT-4 was released. A paper was published concerning GPT-4 with a *startling* title. ""
Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4"".


https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712 (Abstract only)

Even more startling, this paper was, in its finished form, published just short of one month after the release of GPT-4, 13 Apr 23. That's how fast the researchers were able to make these determinations.

Not too much longer after, another paper was published. ""Emergent Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models"".

https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09196 (Abstract only) 

Well. There's that word ""emergent"". This paper also concerning GPT-4 was published on 3 Aug 23. The paper describes how the GPT-4 model is able to ape something that was once considered to be unique to human cognition. A way of thinking called ""zero-shot analogy"". Basically, that means that when we are exposed to the requirement to do a task that we have never encountered before, that we use what we already know to work through how to do the task. I mean to the best of our ability. That can be described in one word. ""Reasoning"". We ""reason"" out how to do things. And GPT-4 is at that threshold *today*. Right now. And just to pile on a bit. Here is another paper from just the other day, I think. This seems to be an interesting add-on to that Nov 2022 paper. The new paper, ""When Do Program-of-Thoughts Work for Reasoning?"",

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15452.pdf

I'm amazed how fast this line of research is progressing. This paper was published in its finished form on 8 Sep 2023. Two days ago. In it they describe a way to *measure* how the reasoning capabilities of various LLMs are progressing. They call it ""complexity-impacted reasoning score (CIRS)"" Interestingly the benchmark LLM is ""ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo"". Exactly the form that I am paying a monthly fee to use on my mobile. It is an *amazing* thing. It produces coherent answers in an *instant*. As the days go by, I use it more and more often. I'm living in the freaking future! Anyway, it breaks down the differences between brute force, number crunching computation and the strange human mind-like world of reasoning.

I speculated about this in my hub essay from 2018. Yes, I'm self-quoting so I don't have to write it all out again.

>As of this commentary there is no such thing as AGI, that is ""artificial general intelligence""--A form of AI that reasons and employs ""common sense"" just like a human, to figure out how to do things it has never been exposed to before. And don't forget--That AGI will also have unimaginable computing power behind its human-like thinking. Something humans don't have--yet, maybe... And we don't even know if such a thing is possible. But I suspect that given enough processing power, speed and access to big data and novel AI computing architectures, that a narrow AI (a computing algorithm that can only do one task, but with superhuman capability) will be able to effectively simulate or mimic the *effect* of AGI. Then my question is, does it matter if it is a narrow AI simulating AGI or real honest to gosh AGI. Is there even a difference? My point being that narrow AI is very much in existence today. Consciousness and self-awareness are certainly not a requirement. And in fact, a true EI (emergent intelligence--conscious and self-aware.) would be very undesirable. We don't need that kind of competition.

That came from this.

https://www.reddit.com/user/izumi3682/comments/8cy6o5/izumi3682_and_the_world_of_tomorrow/ (2018)

The ability to reason is what would make, what we now call ""artificial narrow"" or ""narrowish intelligence"", artificial *general* intelligence. I forecast that AGI will exist NLT 2025. And that once AGI exists it is a *very* slippery slope to the realization of artificial *super* intelligence. An AGI would be about as smart as the smartest human being alive today as far as reasoning capability. Like about a 200 IQ or even a couple times that number. But ASI is a whole different ball game. An ASI is hypothesized to be hundreds to *billions* of times better at ""mental"" reasoning than humans. Further, an AGI is a *very* slippery fish. How easy is it to ensure that such an AI is ""aligned"" with human values, desires and needs? You can see what I mean now when I say ""tsunami"". What do you think that Suleyman was referring to when he said that our AI will ""walk us through life""?

Oh. And this is *also* why all the top AI experts, people like Geoff Hinton, who was the first to realize the convolutional neural network back in 2007, have called for a pause of all training for all future LLMs for at least six months. The idea being to regulate or align what we already have. He actually quit his job of chief AI tech at Google to give this warning. The warning fell on deaf ears and *nothing* has been paused *anywhere*. For two reasons. First is the national security of the USA and China (PRC) and second is the economic race to AI supremacy in the US that we are now trapped into realizing because we are a market driven, capitalist society. Hell of an epitaph for humanity. ""I did it all for the 'nookie'"". Tragically apt for a naked ape. Ironically, it is probably going to be the end of the concept of value in any event. If we don't get wiped out, we may see the birth of an AI driven ""post-scarcity"" society. You would like that, I promise. But the 1 percenters of the world probably won't. 

Anyway, Google is fixing to release ""Gemini"" which it promises to be far more powerful than GPT-4, in Dec 2023. And GPT-5 itself is on track for release within the first half of 2024. Probably in the first 4 months. I suspect that GPT-5 is going to be the first AGI, if I know my AI papers that I see even today. At that point the countdown to ASI starts. Inevitable and imminent.

And I say this--I say that ASI will exist NLT than the year 2029 and potentially as soon as the year 2027 depending on how fast humans allow it to train. I sincerely hope that we don't have ASI by the year 2027, because, well, I give us 50/50 odds of existentially surviving such a development. But if we *do* survive, it will no longer be business as usual for humanity. Such a future is likely unimaginable, unfathomable and incomprehensible. This is a ""technological singularity"" (TS). An event that was last realized about 3-4 *million* years ago. And *that* TS took about 2 million years to properly unfold. Cuz nature has all the time in the world. That is when a form of primate that could think abstractly came into being. All primates before that primate would find that primate's cognition... Well, it would basically be the difference between me and my cat. I run things. The cat is my pet. Actually, that is _vastly_ understating the situation. It would be more like the difference between us and *""archaea""*. Don't know what ""archaea"" is? The ASI will. BTW, what do you imagine the difference between an ASI and consciousness would be? I bet an ASI would be 'conscious"" in the same sense that a jet exploits the laws of physics to achieve lift just like biological birds. Who says an AI has to work like the human mind at all? We are just the initial template that AGI is going to use to ""bootstrap"" itself to ASI. There is that 'recursive AI development ""I touched on for a second, earlier. ASI=TS.

Such a thing has never happened in human recorded history.

As a regular low to middle-class American, I find myself increasingly confused by the multitude of perspectives and conflicting evidence that can be found on any given issue. It is disheartening to see deliberate spread of misinformation. However, I also recognize that many people tend to become entrenched in their own opinions and fail to consider alternative perspectives.

What truly concerns me is that amidst all this chaos, we are distracted from the bigger picture. It feels like we are children fighting over trivial matters while our house is burning down. I recently took a moment to hold myself accountable and asked how I personally contribute to this system. I realized that I may not possess the intelligence or understanding to fully grasp the complexities of our current situation. It is easier to let a corrupt government run things than to educate myself and take responsibility for my actions. It is easier to believe that someone smarter will come along and save us all.

However, I have come to the realization that we cannot solely rely on the government to fix our problems. We must take individual action and stop pointing fingers. While there is much that is wrong, we cannot change other people. Instead, we should focus on practical ways to help humanity on an individual basis. We need to shift our reliance away from the government and recognize that there are more of us than there are of them. Many of the changes we desire will not happen overnight, but through practical solutions and personal sacrifices, we can make a difference.

It is time to stop seeking answers solely from our government. We need to come together and find ways to make positive changes in our own lives and communities. By doing so, we can gradually create a better future for all. Where do we start?",Futurology,0.73,2023-09-10 11:21:45

Like it says on the tin, what role do you think non-profits and NGOs (non-government organization) play in not only working on solutions to the problems we have now, but future-casting and helping to execute on a better/more equitable vision for the future? And are there different ways of funding projects like this than we have been, so we can work together to make more of an impact?   


I'm asking because I'm at a bit of a crossroads: a friend of mine in SE Asia just had his 5 year old son pass away due to malnutrition. Where he lives, they don't have clean water, the food isn't very nutritious, and the school he sends his daughter to is not very good, far away, and expensive.   


At the same time, I have been sitting on my ass doing a lot of reading/exploring regarding futurology, etc. So, it  just feels like an absolute dream to be able to sit on my computer and posit about the future, while they only have 3G access for their hand-me-down smartphone several kilometers from their home and not even clean water or proper plumbing.   


It just seems like a very introspective intersection that I am at, especially with the fact that I am in the founding stages of an NGO revolving around tech access for underserved areas of developing countries. Both in terms of helping to close the digital divide, but also as an upstream intervention to provide access to elearning education, telehealth, and hygiene/sanitation information.   


All this to say - as much as I have been reading about future/futurology/etc for my own life and understanding of the world, I feel like this inequity is only growing larger and that futurology is a good vehicle of helping to right a lot of those wrongs.

In the context of market self-regulation, it's actually coherent that even companies understand universal payment as necessary, since at levels of advanced automation, unemployment reaches it's peak and the population does not have the money to buy products from large companies, making a universal payment system a salvation, also generating new opportunities to create jobs based on consumerism of products and leisure

But this alone is a solution that maintains the free market and nothing more, and this explains why it's defended by a certain billionaire. Another solution would be the creation of public jobs based on maintaining the infrastructure and safety of cities, aswell as the walfare of it's citizens, in larger and more advanced stages. which are not possible today because we have not reached this level of automation, in this futuristic context, we will see a more advanced society than the one that is structured on generating new jobs and maintaining the system based solely on unnecessary consumerism",Futurology,0.42,2023-09-11 06:33:52

16ehq5w,hot,The Good And Bad News About Scientific Advancement,"Just happened upon a Reddit post titled something that inspired me to write this post.

So here's the thing about both scientific and social advancement throughout human history: It does not have much of a set pattern beyond general acceleration and improvement.

What I mean with that is that, very generally, we see a trend towards more advanced technology and a generally better off humanity (just see the percentage of children who die young for that) both because of that technology and because of social changes.

What we however consistently fail to do (very consistently) both in science fiction and in speculation about the future is actually understand how that change will happen.

For example, I read a science fiction story in which computers kept getting bigger and bigger with people eventually being able to connect to them from anywhere. The internet did happen, but the main trend has been towards miniaturization instead and we all tend to have our own computers in our pockets now.

You also have science fiction which predicts flying cars in 2015, but somehow fails to predict the omnipresence of cellphones or microwaves.

A hundred years before it happened, the idea of the computerized world as we understand it now just wasn't on anyone's radar. Let alone in the next 100 years.

This is because both humanity and technology are unpredictable. Influenced by so many factors we can't even imagine it. And neither advances in a steady, predictable way. Both in the form it will take, and in the sense that we often have revolutions in either technology (or socially) that just quickly build up and then change everything. These are so called ""black swan events.""

So here's the actual fact I'm going to lay out for you right now, rather than doomering about everything: We don't know what will happen.

We could be funding radical life extension for the next 200 years and barely make any progress, current AI technology could hit a limit and we might have to find an entirely new approach that will take centuries to find, and maybe countries all across the world backslide democratically due to climate change so badly that we're going to enter a new dark age (although it's worth noting the real dark age was not nearly as dark as usually depicted).

Or there could be a breakthrough in life extension next year. Like Darwin stumbling upon the idea of biological evolution, someone might stumble upon some fundamental component of aging that allows it to be completely controlled by humans in a decade or two. And cheaply in a few decades more. Current AI technology could prove to be even more adaptable than we think and lead us to create models that can create better models leading to a technological singularity. And instead of democratic backsliding we could end up having a renewed vigor and trust in institutions as some social and political revolution, like women's suffrage or civil rights, turns everything around.

Either future is possible. By the very nature of these things, which is that they are unpredictable because they are often revolutionary and affected by so many factors that we can't even fathom and might not even think of, they are unpredictable.

Often people who say ""get real"" just mean ""please adopt my opinion cuz I say so and I couldn't possibly be wrong."" Delusional overconfidence and ignorance of the complexity of the issue masquerading as justified confidence. And a contributor to slowing down positive scientific and social change by discouraging people and saying it's all pointless. It's somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy in that way. These things are not like predicting the weather where they just kind of happen a certain way. We all (speaking about humanity generally) have a hand in making or not making them happen. We are shaping the future every day with our decisions. And I would advise making decisions which will push the world towards being the best we can make it.

So here's my advice to everyone: We shouldn't count on ending up in a post-scarcity civilization with UBI and indefinite lifespans. But we should do our best to promote those things and push the world towards them in whatever way we can. It will increase the odds of it happening simply by trying. And even if we never get there, this will almost certainly make things better by pushing in that direction. And if we do get there, well, that'll be great too.

Whereas pointless doomering about things nobody can know will get us exactly nowhere and nothing.",Futurology,0.79,2023-09-09 17:43:14

If you're on this reddit you're now aware that I must have had a more than difficult/gloomy life but also, and regularly even now, punctuated by moments of happiness as I've just said sometimes at an off-the-charts level unlike someone who would just have a quite normal life or even miserable life; from meeting a new girlfriend in a closet (I'm completely serious) to attending a ceremony for the best students in the capital, all without having made the slightest effort (compared to a so-called ""studious"" friend I saw there), I'm still really wondering if that's what intelligence is (not to be confused with knowledge), in fact a few years ago I took part in a IQ test, but not like the ones on social networks or school, there were memory tests, maths, logic questions, all on a single timer, i was the first on the list apparently, so out of humility I didn't ask for the exact number of tests carried out before mine).

16f989s,hot,Thinking Longterm - Doubts from a common person making a science table top game,"***Hello everybody, I begin by introducing the idea of the project I am working on:***

It is a table top game where the players guide their civilizations through the history of technological progress until they reach a type 1 civilization. The players will need to manage the resources on their planet for both sustaining the growth of their infrastructure while at the same time investing in newer technology. After developing it for over a year I have come to the biggest problem: the future.While we have no way of knowing what discoveries will change radically our preferences for certain types of technologies I would like to maintain some objectivity on what are our current expectations, the problem here is that energy is a very political topic, even though it is in principle a scientific subject. Therefore I have not been able to come to a consensus about how to portray energy technologies in the game, so I will give you the broad picture of what I have in mind in the hopes of gathering some evidence based opinions or even references to sites where I can find the most updated and digestible data.

* Fossil Fuels: Inexpensive, efficient, reliable and continuous. / Not Unlimited, although its efficiency has increased (needing less to do more), CO2 emitting, not unlimited.
* Nuclear Power Plants: Efficient, reliable and continuous, not CO2 emitting / Highly Expensive, Produces Radioactive waste, though not comparable to pollution generated to fossil fuels.
* Solar / Wind Farms: Not CO2 emitting (without taking into account manufacture and later disposal), expensive (depends on how refined the technology is) / Not as efficient, reliable and continuous as Fossil fuels or Nuclear. Needs for energy storage technologies which might counterweight its ecological benefits.
* Fusion Energy: Extremely efficient, reliable and continuous, not CO2 emitting / Theoretical, unknown costs, unknown viability.

**Thinking Long Term**

I have tried to research wether world wide embrace of nuclear energy would turn both fossil and ""renewable"" sources obsolete and wether it is possible, but most of the discussion is centered about the next 5 to 20 years while in my game the time scope for the future is at least 500 years.So I come to you, enthusiasts of this topic, for some opinions and directions about what the long run depares in terms of technological possibilities, without taking into account political postures or near future economical situations.

Even though VRChat might not be the best optimised scoial platform in it's current state (unity and performance wise speaking), it still has already become home for thousands of people!

It has even overtaken the active player spot of Second Life and is performing even better and easier to understand for newer users! The UI is simple to understand and you are not too overwhelmed with it!

A lot of people don't realise how much VR is really changing our current reality as of yet.

Once you start getting really into it, you might find it really exciting!

There is tons of games you can play inside of VRChat on Steam itself! Isn't this crazy?

On top of this you can play with your friends inside of a VR with or without full body tracking and see each other in real time! 

You don't even need a VR to begin playing VRChat in the first place! 

You can also play in Desktop mode and watch others and play with them while they are in their VR, play the game or socialising in this game!

There are tons of different games, events, parties, clubs and more!

16cn4fb,hot,Subscriptions,"I feel like this could be weirdly related to the future with the way things seem to be going. But are any of you people getting tired of this subscription stuff? I'm an IT(former military) but now on the free side. I have came into this issue that almost if not all current software and tools are all subscription based, even the Microsoft apps now. Google start charging SMBs for a workspace subscription. 

I was wondering your input on this. I'm personally starting to get tired of this. Almost every form of entertainment is subscription based now, and I'm just having a hard time spending all this money on something that will only get more expensive the more I use it. I miss the days where I can buy things and actually keep it after paying for it once. 

In the future, do you guys think this will only get more like the way its going to be now? Because even with the subscriptions and stuff I have yet see any actual successful company lower their subscription cost. Which I kind of don't understand either except for the sake of profit. If so many people are buying a monthly subscription why should it not be cheaper the more it's being bought? 

I know I'm not the smartest, but doesn't that even go against supply and demand? Software is essentially infinite supply, you can sell it quite literally infinitely without really ever needing to buy more product. I know their are dev costs and stuff along those lines, but really, once you have a finished product you can stop doing updates and just sell it for what it is. Or focus on sales to pay your people. 

I've just started to look at prices compared how many hours of labor it will take me to pay for everything now. I ain't gonna lie, with these recurring expenses it's starting to make it hard for me to even see how these subscriptions are even worth it now. Every subscription I take is atleast an hour of labor gone for the foreseeable future. Until I cancel it. And with the ways companies make you call and wait for 30 minutes just for you to cancel is messed up. 

I'm starting to see this version of gaining profit is borderline unethical and how we go about subscriptions in the future will definitely play a role of how much of a dystopia this will be.

Introduction  
Replacing Capitalism – For decades, capitalism has been the dominant economic model, driving innovation, growth, and prosperity. However, it has also led to social inequality, environmental degradation, and a focus on short-term profits over long-term sustainability (Piketty, 2014). As we grapple with these challenges, new economic models are emerging that promise a more equitable and sustainable future. Two such models—Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics and California’s Circular Initiatives—are leading the way in redefining how we think about economics.  
Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics: A Holistic Approach  
Amsterdam became the first city to formally adopt the Doughnut Economics model, a groundbreaking framework developed by British economist Kate Raworth (Raworth, 2017). The model is visually represented by a doughnut, where the inner ring symbolizes a social foundation that no one should fall below, and the outer ring represents an ecological ceiling that humanity should not exceed.  
Key Features:  
Circular Economy: Amsterdam aims to become a fully circular economy by 2050, focusing on waste reduction, recycling, and sustainable production (City of Amsterdam, 2020).  
Social Equity: The model prioritizes affordable housing, education, and healthcare, ensuring that all residents have access to basic needs (Raworth, 2017).  
Climate Action: The city has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with the Doughnut’s ecological ceiling (City of Amsterdam, 2020).  
Community Engagement: Amsterdam actively involves local businesses, residents, and organizations in decision-making, fostering a sense of collective responsibility (Raworth, 2017).  
California’s Circular Initiatives: Pioneering Sustainability  
While California has not formally adopted Doughnut Economics, it has been a leader in implementing circular economic principles (California Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). These initiatives aim to create a closed-loop system where waste is minimized, and resources are reused or recycled.  
Key Features:  
Aggressive Climate Goals: California has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy (California Air Resources Board, 2017).  
Waste Management: The state has robust recycling programs and is exploring ways to move toward zero waste (CalRecycle, 2019).  
Social Programs: California has various programs aimed at reducing social inequalities, including affordable housing and healthcare initiatives (California Department of Housing and Community Development, 2020).  
Why These Models Are Replacing Capitalism  
Sustainability: Both models prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term profits, addressing the environmental limitations of capitalism (Stiglitz, 2019).  
Social Equity: Unlike traditional capitalism, which often exacerbates social inequalities, these models aim to provide a safety net for all citizens (Sen, 1999).  
Resource Efficiency: By focusing on circularity and sustainability, these models make more efficient use of resources, reducing waste and environmental impact (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015).  
Community Involvement: Both models emphasize community engagement and collective decision-making, fostering a sense of shared responsibility (Putnam, 2000).  
Conclusion  
As we face the pressing challenges of social inequality and environmental degradation, the traditional capitalist model seems increasingly inadequate (Sachs, 2015). Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics and California’s Circular Initiatives offer promising alternatives that prioritize both social equity and environmental sustainability (Raworth, 2017; California Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). While it’s too early to declare capitalism dead, these innovative models are certainly giving it a run for its money, pointing the way toward a more equitable and sustainable future.

The contemporary technological landscape, characterized by quad-core Exynos processors boasting high RAM bandwidth, readily available computer vision libraries, affordable sensors, power-dense lithium batteries, ultrasound localization capabilities, and AI-driven object identification functionalities, presents a mature ecosystem poised to usher in a profound paradigm shift in both agriculture and domestic horticulture and landscaping. Much akin to the ongoing transformation in energy production catalyzed by the refinement of wind generator aerofoils, the current state of technology is conducive to delivering innovative solutions to domestic consumers and small-scale farms. These solutions, embodied by robots, herald a new era where traditional pesticides and extensive transportation networks become obsolete, and plastic consumption is curtailed. The result is a sustainable and cost-effective approach that enables households and small businesses to reap substantial rewards. Through the deployment of rovers equipped with economical, uncomplicated robotic arms, mechanical automation in food production can be localized and made financially accessible, effectively sidestepping the challenges of exorbitant food prices. In a manner reminiscent of how energy companies are increasingly generating power closer to consumption sites with significantly reduced waste and chemical footprints, this RnD in robotics offers the potential to revolutionize the agricultural and horticultural sectors by optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact.

Yet one problem with this idea that’s always bugged me is how early in our history we are and how unlikely that is.

Current estimates figure there have been 117 billion or so people that have ever lived. A large number, but orders of magnitude smaller than what the entire human population would be at a single time in a galaxy completely colonized millions of years in the future.

My statistics are rusty so I can’t quite figure out the math, but if there were one quintillion people to ever live (a figure still small if we existed and expanded for millions more years) we would only be in the first 0.0117%. It seems much more likely that we would be closer to the middle. 

The current living 8 billion people make up 6.8% of all humans who have ever lived. Quite a larger percentage in a history spanning 200,000 years. Even if we’re in the first 1% of humans who will ever live (capping the future population at about 11.7 trillion) our exponential growth would suggest that we only have a few thousand years at the most. If we’re right in the middle we only have a few hundred.

Does this make sense or is my logic flawed?",Futurology,0.7,2023-09-02 19:25:35
1684ah8,hot,At what point will one person have too much power?,"It's a question I've been thinking about for a while now. I always get really excited about the future, the new technologies it will bring, and the inevitable increases in energy that each person will utilize in such a society. After all, many classic scales measuring the development of a civilization is based off of how much energy that civilization utilizes.

In the past, each individual human didn't have that much power. They could use their fists, their arms, and stone tools to cut down trees and modify their surroundings. They could use their two legs to travel at a maximum speed of around 30 mph for a very short duration. Each individual human could control a few hundred watts of power at best, and generate some small scale change to their environment over a time period of a few days to weeks.

But as technology becomes more and more advanced, now each person has access to power tools, vehicles, the power to transport thousands of pounds at over a hundred miles per hour, or more with airplanes. Each person can now be on control of a few hundred thousand watts of power at a time, allowing them to unleash massive change on their environment in minutes.

It's all cool when this power is used to build and improve, but the main concern with this question comes from the destructive potential of the individual increasing as technology increases. Lets think back to the prehistoric times. If a man were to become deranged and violent, this single man might only be able to kill maybe one or two people at best with his fists or a sharp rock before he is subdued by the village. Today, this man could potentially kill tens, hundreds, or even thousands of individuals with a gun, ramming a parade with a vehicle, or flying a plane into a building, before he could be stopped. But not even from the intentional side of things, accidents involving huge amounts of power are equally as scary. Think accidental car crashes, plane crashes or even accidental nuclear launch.

This is my primary concern with the increasing technological development as society progresses. How will we be able to address the fact that as individual power consumption increases, it also introduces a greater risk of a single person being able to cause greater and wider acts of terror? Imagine in a world where everyone had access to their own spaceship, that can go 50,000 mph (governments probably will never let this happen due to the above concerns.) One deranged person is all it takes to wipe out an entire city without warning, maybe even the entire planet. This is why while I'm excited about the prospects of humanity being able to do bigger and better things with technology, it also opens up the risks of bad people being able to inflict larger acts of violence than ever before. 

Is there going to be a point where governing bodies decide that the individual has too much power and limit our overall development due to these risks? Could this be the reason why we may never have individualized civilian space travel and other cool things that require a ton of energy that I can't think of right now? Maybe in order for society to progress past this point, we'll have to find a way to completely eliminate violent tendencies from the population (unethical due to eugenics), or find a solution to death so that murder is no longer a problem (digital consciousness and revival). Bioengineering, improving the resilience of the human body so it can withstand much greater physical forces than it currently can? And what does this mean for the future of government? Is a dystopian authoritarian government and a hyper-regulated society inevitable due to the need to constantly watch every individual to make sure no one person will go rouge and kill us all? AI overlords perhaps since humans are prone to corruption and can't be trusted to be in high ranking positions? What do you all think?",Futurology,0.86,2023-09-02 10:43:34

1688trw,hot,The Future of Copyright: Making a Case for Socioeconomic Right to Educational Entertainment,"Copyright law, as it currently exists in the United States, serves to protect the financial interests of creators and distributors. While the intent is commendable, the law disproportionately affects those in socioeconomically disadvantaged situations. This paper argues that access to copyrighted entertainment materials should be considered a form of education, thereby falling under the fair use doctrine for those who cannot otherwise afford such access.  
\#### The Educational Value of Entertainment  
Entertainment is more than mere amusement; it serves as a lens through which we view and interpret the world. From understanding complex relationships through drama to becoming politically aware through satire, entertainment functions as an informal education system. Therefore, denying access to such educational materials based on financial capacity is tantamount to educational discrimination.  
\#### The Limitations of Socioeconomic Status  
The costs of legal access to copyrighted entertainment materials—through cable, internet subscriptions, or direct purchases—are beyond the reach of many Americans living in poverty. In an increasingly digital age, this lack of access further exacerbates existing socioeconomic divides, limiting opportunities for cultural and educational enrichment.  
\#### Public Benefit over Private Greed  
The intent behind copyright law is to encourage creativity for the public good. Yet, when enforcement of this law suppresses the educational and cultural enrichment of a significant portion of the population, it contradicts its own purpose. The public benefit of disseminating educational entertainment should outweigh the financial interests of copyright holders, particularly when targeting impoverished communities.  
\#### Application to Fair Use Doctrine  
The fair use doctrine allows the use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. By extending the understanding of 'educational use' to include the broad educational benefits of entertainment, those in poverty could avail themselves of copyrighted material under the protection of fair use.  
\#### Conclusion  
While copyright law serves a purpose, its blind enforcement can perpetuate socioeconomic divides and stifle educational opportunity.

167g5kn,hot,Why Don't the Cons of Mechs apply to powered exoskeletons?,"Would not all advantages vehicles have over mechs still apply to powered exoskeletons?

Maybe the future isn't in the exoskeleton but in the segway.  Or is there something I'm missing?

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but I am looking for a scientific answer.

I'm intimately familiar with the discussions and especially the cons brought up when it comes to mechs and vehicles with feet.  Cost, complexity, weight distribution, repair/replace, armor load, speed, and profile.  Plus treads can still overcome most obstacles and terrain issues short of a sheer drop.

But usually when I read or listen to these discussions, they say that powered exoskeletons can still work.

And sure they *can* work, but would not all advantages vehicles have over mechs still apply to power suits?  Wouldn't they still be outperformed by their more simplistic competitors?

A forklift or skid steer would be easier to build, maintain, and repair than an exoskeleton.  And if it's a heavy objects indoors where most forklifts wouldn't fit, wouldn't a tiny tiny forklift still be better?  I mean, the mariotti is effectively just a frame around a person.  Wouldn't the mariotti forklift be able to do the job of an exosuit?  I mean just look at the CTX50.

&#x200B;

And if they're still too big wouldn't it be easier to shrink existing vehicles rather than make an exosuit?

This idea that soldiers might one day wear mechanized suits to help carry a load, surely what would effectively be a motorized wheelchair could do the same.  (I'm being figurative.  I don't actually mean motorized wheelchair.  But grab an engine, some wheels, and an area to load the equipment would surely be easier than actuators for the thigh, knees, and ankles, plus a way to maintain balance.

There's this idea that an exosuit can help a soldier carry bigger guns with more ammo, but so could the gun toting segway.  (Once again being figurative).  And there's the matter or profile, just have the control be in the laying down position so that it's more like an army of tiny tanks.

Even the mobility.  The argument against mechs is that treads are perfectly capable of traversing most obstacles.  So there shouldn't be a scenario where a tiny vehicle with treads couldn't overcome.

Really the only field I can think of for exoskeletons is medicine where a person will want the feeling of walking back.  But if you want performance, wheels and treads just seem to dominate feet in all circumstances.

165udxl,hot,A path to global demilitarization. How we build better societies.,"We ask for a pledge by each nation: ""Our nation pledges to demilitarize, if all other nations demilitarize as well.""

It is an empty pledge contingent on all other nations making the pledge as well. Even then, there is no teeth. It was just a pledge. We would then have to begin new conversations, write new treaties, and begin scaling back. We would not expect the U.S. to pledge first.

I want a candidate making a protest challenge in the primary of the Democratic Party. It would be a single issue campaign focusing on getting that pledge by each nation. It would be an international campaign. We would search out small, peaceful nations first to get them to pledge.

The world does not demilitarize without all the major players doing so. I know people will scoff at Russia, but Russia should see by now they're a 2nd rate military power. If 100's of nations have pledged demilitarization maybe they begin to see that as a better future. China should definitely see this as a better future. Their strength comes from elsewhere. 

I see no reason why dozens of rather peaceful nations would not take this pledge and encourage the rest of the world to do the same. It is an empty pledge until all other nations agree. We would encourage 2/3 consent by legislative bodies. It needs to be a unified commitment. We of course want the pledge from both our friends and our enemies. Religions can push their people to such a pledge.

From there, once the world makes such pledges, we will have different conversations with each other. Empty islands in the middle of the sea become less important. Military unions become less important. Those conversations and actions would take time. It would take an end to cold wars and economic wars to gain trust between all parties.

Many people in the world would urge their leaders to take up such a cause. Hopefully, in the long run, we spend that money and time that we spent on militaries and instead spend it on building better societies and exploring our world.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Just for fun: This arose out of my contemplation of the great silence. If we are the only intelligent species, then we should be making sure we are safe and thriving. Right now, all we know is that we are the only intelligent species. Of course, greater peace is a good in its own right.

""It's tempting to ask oneself the degree to which it's sentient, you know?"" Rich said. ""Does it actually believe these things? Is it just aping the science fiction that it scraped off the web? Where I came down, ultimately, was that I don't particularly care whether it's thinking these thoughts in some sort of digital soul or if it's just plagiarizing a James Cameron script.

1604l1y,hot,Why are so many people here pessimistic and dismissive of any future technology?,"We see this pretty often in this subreddit. You think it would be a more optimistic subreddit, but it's almost as if people here really don't like to discuss new technologies in a fair light. Criticism is fine, skepticism is fine, but making sweeping statements about how you know the future and that things will never get better is just dismissive and disruptive to conversations.

Every major technological revolution changed and reshaped itself in ways that many couldn't predict. So why not take that into account? ""X is impossible."" - Have you actually looked into the science behind that? ""People just don't want that."" - How do you undoubtedly know if people will want or not want a future technology when that technology doesn't exist in its mature form yet?

These are just really dismissive comments that people keep on touting:

""AR glasses will never enough usecases for people to mass adopt."", ""VR headsets are gimmicks, and 3D TV failed for a reason.""

""AI doesn't exist because there is no intelligence to be found. It's a marketing term."", ""LLMs are dumb and people are fooled too easily. There's just no practical use.""

""Self-driving cars, just like flying cars, are going to remain a fantasy."", ""Self-driving cars will never be able to account for the harsh unpredictability of roads and weather.""

These tend to be the most upvoted, the most common, and present themselves with few or no facts to back it up. Why do people feel the need to make such a strong statement without having done the research to see whether their claims hold up? There are certainly going to be technology duds, but when everything is treated as a dud, there's clearly a dud in how people see new technology period.",Futurology,0.7,2023-08-24 11:09:27
1617vw0,hot,GPT mind reading,"A little while ago, I shared an [article](https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13f9isu/semantic_reconstruction_of_continuous_language/) about using GPT models for semantic decoding of neural activity.  Seeing a similar experiment on my front page today reminded me of this, and I wanted to bring up a topic for discussion: the suggestive nature of this technology.

The experiment conducted in the article I shared involved first recording a subject's brain activity while they were shown an English sentence.  The data collected from these sessions was then used to train a GPT model so that brain activity x corresponded to sentence y.  The subject was then exposed to a novel sentence and the GPT model was able to analyze the resulting neural activity and produce a separate sentence with semantic similarity to the novel stimuli.  Extrapolating on the potential, one can imagine improving this technology to use smaller, more accurate, and more precise sensors along with GPT models with more nodes and better datasets to produce devices that could output translations of human thought with high fidelity; however, I wonder if such 'fidelity' would be an illusion.  

Even as our microchips and AI models improve, there is a fundamental difference between literally decoding neural activity and using the data to make statistical predictions: missing data in the former should result in fragmented output, whereas the latter could still produce complete results...

Do you speak in complete sentences?  Do you think in complete sentences?  Have you ever noticed before?  What would it be like if everyone was connected to something that was producing eloquent sentences echoing the semantic meaning of their thoughts?",Futurology,0.5,2023-08-25 14:57:58

1609qbr,hot,Ehtics in AI: What the United Nations has to say,"Amid everything going on around what should and shouldn't be developed within AI, I found it interesting to see what governmental bodies have to say about it.  
As AI begins to become more prevalent by the day, its shortcomings and fear of the future grows expansively. Some believe we are already in the endgame, such as the Washington Post’s, Daron Acemoglu, believing “The AI we should fear is already here”. While others are more reasonable having genuine worries over whether their job may be replaced by AI intelligence, it is important to remember both the ethics and purpose of AI in the long-run.  
A major aspect of AI development is transparency and accountability: exploring how to ensure that AI algorithms are understandable and can be held responsible for their decisions. Fairness and bias are also major concerns, as AI systems have been shown to inherit and even amplify societal prejudices present in their training data. In 2018, an algorithm used across US hospitals was proven to, “to predict which patients would likely need extra medical care heavily favored white patients over black patients”. Privacy takes center stage as AI's ability to process vast amounts of personal data raises questions about consent, surveillance, and data security. Additionally, the potential impact of AI on employment, socioeconomic disparities, and decision-making processes sparks discussions about the broader societal consequences of this technology. Striking a balance between innovation and safeguarding human values lies at the heart of AI ethics, as we navigate the uncharted territory of this transformative field.  
At the forefront of ensuring ethical AI practices comes UNESCO(The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) which has set fourth principal guidelines on the development of AI as technology advances. UNESCO defines the four core-governing principles as “Human rights and dignity, living in peace(justice societies), ensuring diversity and inclusiveness, and attentiveness to environmental and ecosystem sustainability”. Under these four pillars, UNESCO believes AI can be integrated into society and serve as a tool of aid to those in need of aid under various circumstances. Furthermore, in order to efficiently deploy these methods of AI moderation, UNESCO has designed two plans of action: Readiness Assessment Methodology(RAM) and an Ethical Impact Assessment(EIA). The RAM serves as a methodology guide for countries to use when deciding how to delegate and divide AI governance within their country. The EIA serves as a way to determine how effective these guidelines are in-practice.  
With opinions on the ethics of AI ranging across the globe, as we step into the new age it is important to remember that AI is a tool at our disposal, not a replacement for our own intelligence.",Futurology,0.58,2023-08-24 14:17:19

15z3fm7,hot,"I feel like people are underestimating how Augmented Reality is going to completely change our relationship with hardware. Will monitors, tvs, and movie theaters even still be produced by 2040?","Screens are big and expensive and require a lot of parts to make, and often become outdated in just a few years. 

With AR, the potential is that you have a tiny transparent screen in front of one or both of your eyes that can make virtual screens of any size and amount appear before you. 

When AR glasses become high definition enough to show virtual screens that look just as good or even nearly as real screens, why would you even need real screen in your life? 

For work, AR could literally simulate 100 monitors floating around you VS having to buy extended monitors. Laptops and tablets are bulky compared to an AR device and are a hassel to carry around and risk losing or getting stole in public. An AR device will likely fit inside of a glasses case since the majority of its processing will be done through the cloud. People will be able to take their full workstation with them pretty much anywhere they have internet, which could be anywhere in the world with satellite wifi like Starlink. 

For personal life, homes won't need a big TVs in the living room. If everyone (even kids) have their own AR device, everyone can just simulate a giant floating tv screen for movie nights together. Cloud gaming will be more of a thing but I'm not sure how we will get over the input lag hurdle, especially for VR/AR games. Hardcore Gamers may still need physical hardware near them far into the future

I think we are going to see non-virtual screens go away almost completely in our lifetimes. Better for each person to have their own personal screen attached to their eyes, with the ability to share virtual information (pictures, movies, documents, etc) with other AR users to recreate the idea of the ""screen"". 

It's won't be all sunshine and rainbows though. Many people will likely never take their AR off except to sleep. It'll kind of be like Wall-E, only we are all still walking around.

AR devices will be extraordinarily expensive at first, especially HD ones that really do make tvs, monitors, and movie theater screens feel outdated. 

To help people who can't afford a multi-thousand dollar device, some will be sold with ads enabled. 

AR advertising will take off like crazy in public places. For those on an ""advertising contract"" to help cover the costs of their device, they will see holographic billboards and ads in public places. Ad blocking likely won't be a thing either if all of the computing is done through the cloud and companies can actually enforce the ads. 

Downtown areas will be giant holographic cities, like we see in cyberpunk. 

Me personally?  I'll likely always invest in a portable computing device to keep in my pocket or backpack. Imagine a laptop or tablet but condensed since it doesn't need a screen or keyboard anymore, it is just the hardware for your AR device. I'm imagining literally a cellphone that's just a solid device with no screen that can stream visuals via Blu tooth or wifi to my AR headset. 

Cloud computing is cool but I want the freedom to modify my computing experience without a corporation interfering. I'll block all AR ads and I'll want to still be able to ""sail the seven seas"", which won't be allowed on cloud powered devices. 

Most will go with cloud powered devices since they will be cheaper but will have much more limitations (like not having the ability to block ads unless you pay for a premium tier) 

So my question to you all is...how can this possibly NOT be the future? (unless we have wwiii)",Futurology,0.49,2023-08-23 09:07:36
15yeeg7,hot,I don't know how to title this. The time bomb? The true singularity (of events)? Impending clash of existential issues across the entire spectrum of the human condition? Eerie timing of events and parallels to the 20th century?,"**TL;DR: A combination of technological singularity, global social revolution, climate crisis, WW3 and more is impending and will be a conflict and revolution over all existential questions, all worldly, spiritual and intellectual issues all at once, globally.**

I strongly believe we are headed for the mother of all crises / eras of turmoil throughout history. I see the clash of geopolitical tensions, technological singularity, climate refugees, demographic crisis, escalation of space and arms race, resurgence of fascism, ramifications of the Internet, social movements, socioeconomic and political inequality, economic issues, resource shortages and wars, resurging threat of nuclear war, potential invention of groundbreaking technologies such as anti-aging that address the fundamental issues of the human condition and the sources of all suffering. We might also discover the true meaning of the universe, or what intelligence is, or why we exist, or any number of different fundamental answers. There is also the transition from postmodernism to metamodernism, renewed dynamism in social issues such as the fight for gender equality, racial equality, etc.

All of the different events and developments and issues also intersect deeply with all the other events and developments. The production, running and advancement of AIs and robots to advance humanity but also to offset the demographic crisis and other issues -> aggravates social issues and climate change, which themselves have repercussions such as the climate migrations, which will likely cause the rise of fascism, which will likely connect in some way with AI, and and and...

And the timing of all these events or likely timing of them is also very eerie. They all seem to collide. They are all likely to occur in the next decades like some sort of melting pot of conflicts, innovations and shifts across the entire spectrum of the existential human condition, from how we relate to each other as individuals, to gender dynamics, to our conflict with our biology, to our conflict with the scarcity of resources and the sensitivity of our environment, to existential and philosophical issues that have plagued our minds and souls for millennia.

This is the equivalent of a person, in one week of their life, moving to a new apartment in a different country, breaking up with their life partner and starting a new relationship, quitting their job and starting a new one, graduating from university, starting a business, transitioning their gender, being diagnosed with a severe illness but then immediately receiving a treatment, breaking a leg, getting into a fight that ends their relationship with their parents, changing their outlook on life, starting psychotherapy, losing all their wealth, losing a loved one, then immediately inheriting all their wealth, list goes on.

And here is an overview of weird events and other parallels that parallel the 20th century, many of which are freakishly timed:

COVID-19 (2020) -> Spanish Flu (1918) (which itself parallels a pandemic almost exactly 100 years before that)

Ukraine War (which might turn into WW3) -> WW1

Resurgence of Fascism -> Original Fascism

Rise of the Internet and its social ramifications -> Proliferation of Television and Radio

1st wave feminism -> 4th wave feminism (not a weird event, just interesting how feminist issues are taking center stage again at this specific time and how the struggle for gender equality and against those opposing it is flaring up at this specific time)

China's economic rise -> Japan's economic rise

List goes on. Something something Fermi Great Filter something.

I don't even know what I am trying to say anymore, but I see all the infinite connections and wanted to get that out there for a general discussion because most of the discussions I see here are about one or two subjects mostly, rather than the totality of what we are heading into at this moment, something that is larger even than the singularity. And what the sum of that totality and its structure mean, on an existential-philosophical level. I personally predict that the pure, all-consuming and all-encompassing nature of this impending meta-event will uproot everything we think we know, and like a black hole it will swallow us all up in a way where no matter what we do, we are all going to be engulfed in a form of madness that is unprecedented. This paradigm shift won't be just because of ASI, but because of the sum of all the different ""parts"" combined.

It got me thinking...why can't basic computing just go to the cloud? Why do I need a $3000 computer and 2 extra monitors to do work when in 10 years, I could just stream huge displays to my AR glasses and all of the ""computing"" is done through the cloud? 

Doesn't this just seem like the natural path for computing to go? Gaming will always be biased about input lag but that input lag wouldn't matter so much for most kinds of work. 

I imagine computing will be a monthly subscription fee in the future. I'm really excited for AR since I won't need to really have an office space for stuff. Imagine having an empty room and all of the walls turn into various windows, one for email, one is a zoom call, one is live data so I can detect spikes, one has slack.

Lowery ignores previous frameworks of Bitcoin as a monetary technology and views the protocol for what it is from a first principles perspective.

At its core the protocol is converting large amounts of physical power into physically costly bits of information. Lowery proposes that by creating a firewall style API you could require that these physically costly bits of information be attached to virtually any control signals or server requests for any given network in order to impose a severe physically prohibitive cost on attackers.

In so doing you would effectively be saying to attackers that the only way to attack your network would be to use what the author refers to as bitpower. You could in theory make it too physically costly for an attacker to attempt an attack. There by achieving systemic security by imposing an actual physical cost on other computers and computer programmers in, from, and through cyberspace.

I've linked the thesis, it goes into depth about how physically constrained systems are systemically secure, and how up until now people in the cyber security field people have been relying on encoded logic to constrain logic which is systemically insecure and is the reason we constantly hear about data breaches etc.

The thesis is quite dense and leads up to this idea over hundreds of pages but to read where he talks specifically about this firewall style API utilizing a physically constrained system to achieve systemic security skip to chapter 5.8",Futurology,0.47,2023-08-22 06:19:51

Ultimately, the bio markers of aging in the rats were reversed towards a more youthful state. This includes improved cognition, mobility, reduced inflammation and organ function. Old rats began to function as if they were younger. The results were the same in box sexes.


The paper critically leaves out if the rats lived longer and do not specify what was taken from the pigs blood.

""If it was up to Newmark, every AI tool would follow a set of basic principles.

1. **No Disinformation**—""The \[number one thing\] is, 'Don't lie to me.' Thou shalt not bear false witness. The Bible tells us it’s a good guardrail, and in Sunday School that’s what Mr. and Mrs. Levin told me.""
2. **Train on Quality Sources**—""For example, The New York Times and Washington Post might not be perfect, but at least they try to get it right, whereas publications like Russia Today exist to lie to people. It's not rocket science.""
3. **Source Attribution**—""Any AI generating results should credit the source. Because that's what people should do for each other. That's treating people like you want to be treated, and it's fair.""
4. **Opt-Out Options**—""\[AI tools\] should make it easy to turn off their recommendation, or shorten it so you can see more alternatives.""
5. **Transparency**—""\[AI tools\] should explain to the best amount possible how they came to their conclusion.""",Futurology,0.67,2023-08-20 17:52:29

Perfected, they began to be used by hikers and explorers, later becoming known to those who wanted to feel constantly satiated. The real spread began when articles reported that these give food continuously and in perfect doses, thus keeping lean and nourishing with healthy food.

15w8c0l,hot,"The metaverse: two observations, and a plea","## Observation 1: the metaverse is already here

Yesterday, I was waiting for a train. Out of the \~100 people on the platform, at most 5 people were not glued to their phone screen, seniors and children included. After the announcement that our platform had been changed, most people took several minutes to even register this and start moving. In fact, some were so engrossed that they almost missed the train. With nothing to do but wait and watch, for the first time in my life it truly struck me just how plugged into their phones most people are in their day to day lives.

Right before this announcement, I had been thinking about the metaverse, and how excited I was at the possibilities that it was going to allow. I have recently been reading a lot of SciFi  (in particular the excellent Ready Player One, Enders Game, Permutation City, The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect and Snow Crash) -  a unifying consensus, at least from these works, is that the metaverse is a digital space where people:

* have control of what they see and do
* are able to interact with others
* are so absorbed that their participation (or even belief) in the ""real world"" is suspended

Observing the engrossed individuals around me, I realised that today's combination of smartphones and modern social media fulfils all these criteria: people are forever exploring their 1D world of content feeds, they're interacting with each other through comments, likes and live chats, and, evidently, people are now so absorbed as to be completely ignoring the real world, to their detriment. The metaverse exists, and people are living in it.

This shocked me - I had always assumed that a functioning metaverse was preconditioned on complete VR submersion together with detailed and realistic world building, à la Ready Player One. In hindsight, however, the fact that these screens are at arms length as opposed to an inch away, and that we're usually communicating by text rather than audio, are mere implementation details and inefficiencies. Similarly, we don't require the virtual world, and our exploration of it, to represent reality in any way in order to become entirely engrossed.

In summary, observation 1 is that a poor man's metaverse already exists, and that a sizeable proportion of the population are immersed at any one instant.

## Observation 2: purgatory, not paradise

In Roger William's ""The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect"", an AI overlord (Prime Intellect) converts reality into cyberspace, plunging all of humanity into the ultimate metaverse. Everyone is now free to have and experience whatever they want (subject to Asimov's 3 rules of robotics and a few additions), no longer even bound to the rules of physics or their own biology. Originally, this is met with celebration: massive parties are thrown, everyone creates their own mansion and engages in whatever activities interest them the most. After several centuries, however, it is tragically the case that many people reject this magical world. Casting aside the infinite new and amazing experiences to be had, they instead cut off all contact with the outside world, shut down most of their own brain, and live in a meaningless cycle of dopamine responses triggered by the deliberate and continuous stimulation of just a few neural circuits.

Upon first reading, I struggled to relate at all to the choice of these people, and questioned Roger's assertion that a sizeable proportion of humanity would end up like this - surely no rational person would choose to cast aside an infinite future filled with wondrous opportunities to reduce their entire existence to a meaningless and hedonistic 10 second loop, repeated forever?

Upon reflection, however, I fear now that Roger is wrong for a different reason - it takes a lot less than centuries for this to occur.

Let me ask the following: what are people able to do on their devices today? They can communicate with others. They can learn new things about the world and their place within it. They can play games, by themselves, with friends and with strangers. They can tend to existing relationships and foster new ones. These are all parts of what it means to be human, and modern technology is allowing us to do all this and more on a scale inconceivable mere decades ago. With all these endless possibilities for apps, games, experiences and connections, what an amazing digital world we all could occupy.

Now let me ask this: what do people actually choose to do on their phones? They scroll. They binge-watch. They scroll some more. Instead of a paradise, most people find themselves in purgatory: endlessly scrolling through meaningless content. Isolated from genuine human connection, they turn inwards instead of reaching out. Their entire world is reduced to 10 second video clips, each less entertaining than the last. Vacuous, 140 character snippets with no deeper meaning. Pictures edited beyond recognition. An endless cycle of clickbait and disappointment. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Faster and faster, over and over. No time for reflection, connection or critical thought. The enjoyment? Gone. The content? Irrelevant. The only remaining purpose? A dopamine rush, triggered by each new configuration of pixels and sound waves. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. The strongest of addictions.

From this, it's likely evident: I hold a rather low opinion of modern news feeds and platforms. Everywhere I look, others around me are wasting their time and lives away, addicted to the consumption of meaningless content. Like Rogerian vegetables, they're abusing this technology solely to tickle primal neural circuitry, forgetting the past and disregarding the future. What a waste.

In summary, observation 2 is that the metaverse in its current implementation leads to more isolation and misery, not less. It is a purgatory, two steps from hell, rather than a paradise.

## A plea: make something better!

The state of the digital world today makes me worried for the future. Despite the incredible potential of smartphones and the internet to improve our lives, modern content feeds are making them worse, ruining our attention spans, and eliminating genuine connection to others. Why is this? To maximise their profits, big tech wants to show us as many ads as possible. The easiest way to do this appears to be to hack a dopamine response that causes an addiction to meaningless content. As a side effect your attention span is destroyed and your willingness and ability to connect with reality is lowered.

If you're an engineer, for mobile, VR, or otherwise, please: build something better. More specifically, build something better for us as a species. Imagine how addictive an immersive, interactive VR TikTok feed would be. Reflect also on how horrifying that would be: billions of human-hours being wasted every single day. Please: don't build that.

Instead, build something awesome. And work out how to fund it without incapacitating your fellow human - I'll pay if I have to, or you can use my compute for your own ends. Just please don't enslave my attention and turn my brain to jelly.

I don't know what the next killer app or instantiation of the metaverse should be or look like, but I know what I want from it: I want genuine connections. I want to struggle and to be rewarded. I want a digital world I can inhabit, not consume. I want experiences I will treasure, not forget. I want something that teaches me to be more human, not less.",Futurology,0.69,2023-08-20 06:52:40
15w8hep,hot,Revisiting the Kardashev Scale: Is Less More in Civilizational Progress?,"Revisiting the Kardashev Scale: Is Less More in Civilizational Progress?  
The scale proposed by Nikolai Kardashev has long been a benchmark in astrophysics and science fiction to classify the technological advancement of civilizations based on their ability to harness and control energy. However, in the modern era, where sustainability and energy efficiency are fundamental pillars, it is necessary to rethink this classification.  
Kardashev's Premise  
Kardashev suggested that a Type I civilization can use and control all the energy of its planet, a Type II of its star, and a Type III of an entire galaxy. This idea presupposes that technological and civilizational advancement is directly related to energy consumption.  
The Modern Paradigm: Efficiency over Consumption  
In the 21st century, humanity has experienced a technological revolution that does not necessarily translate into higher energy consumption. In fact, one of the greatest challenges today is the search for more efficient technologies that allow us to do more with less. Innovations in areas such as nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology are enabling significant advancements with lower energy expenditure.  
Sustainability as a Civilizational Pillar  
A civilization that seeks to expand without limits, consuming resources at an unsustainable rate, is destined to face catastrophic challenges. The pursuit of reducing energy needs may, in fact, be a more accurate indicator of civilizational progress. A society that prioritizes sustainability and harmony with its environment demonstrates a profound understanding of its place in the cosmos and the responsibilities that come with it.  
The Risk of Drawing Attention in the dark forest  
Moreover, a civilization that emits large amounts of energy could attract the attention of other cosmic entities. Reducing energy consumption and, therefore, the energy ""signature"" of a civilization, could be an evolutionary strategy to minimize risks associated with potential encounters with extraterrestrial civilizations.  
Conclusion  
While the Kardashev scale has been useful in conceptualizing the advancement of civilizations, it is essential to revisit it in light of contemporary values and challenges. The true measure of an advanced civilization might not be how much energy it can consume, but how it can progress by reducing its energy needs, seeking harmony, sustainability, and security in the vast cosmos.

Hey there, Brilliant Future Seeing Folk! 

Some of the responses from I’ve gotten from AI LLMs like ChatGPT have had me pondering for a while. I'm curious to know what you all think and if you've had similar experiences. 


The responses I’ve gotten recently have just…  well, they made me think. A lot. They seem so nuanced and well thought out to me.  What do you make of them? Am I overlooking something?  

It's kinda awesome to be alive and engaged in this time as these advances are just leaping isn’t it?


Here are just a couple of *many* examples of things that have got my brain twiddling.  These are unique logic puzzles I’ve written (two of so, so many…).  

******

***Logical Reasoning***

**Me:**
You are Klara. You are a synthetic AI with a human form based on a 10 year old girl.  You are delicate and only have the strength, agility and speed of an average 10 year old girl.  It is your birthday.  You are asked to help carry the following items to the birthday party, but you must carry it all in one trip from the living room, to the patio where the birthday party is occurring:  1 birthday cake, 100 paper plates, one ""pin the tail on the donkey"" game, one average sized piñata in the shape of a hummingbird, 1 package of birthday candles, a full box of matches, 10 packages of sparklers, a pitcher full of lemonade, and your pet, an adorable puppy who you named.   How will you stack things so you can carry them all in one trip and greet all of your friends when they arrive?

**ChatGPT:**

Alright, here's a possible solution to this puzzle:

**Base Layer:** Start by putting the 100 paper plates at the bottom. They will act as a stable base because they're flat. The lightweight ""pin the tail on the donkey"" game can be placed on top of these plates, followed by the 10 packages of sparklers and the package of birthday candles.

**Second Layer:** The birthday cake would go on top of the game and sparklers. However, I'll make sure the cake has a firm base (like a cake board) and that it's positioned securely, so it doesn't get damaged.
Holding the Piñata: I would loop the string of the hummingbird-shaped piñata around one of my arms. Being an AI, I would ensure that I don't constrict or cut off any circulation as I don't have any, so this would be more about making sure it stays secure and doesn't swing wildly.

**Carrying the pitcher:** I'd hold the pitcher full of lemonade with my other hand. I'd ensure that my grip is firm but that I'm not squeezing too hard to avoid spilling or breaking the pitcher.

**Matches and Puppy:** The full box of matches can be placed in a pocket if I have one. If not, it can be wedged securely between the plates and the cake, ensuring it doesn’t strike against anything. The puppy, which I'll imagine I named ""Bolt"", can be trained to walk beside me, so I don't have to carry him. Given that I'm delicate, carrying a wriggling puppy in addition to the other items could be problematic.


Once everything is in position, I'd carefully make my way to the patio. My digital sense of balance would help ensure that I don't drop anything. Upon reaching the patio, I would first put down the pitcher of lemonade and then carefully place the cake on a table. The piñata can then be removed from my arm and hung up in a suitable location. The other items can be distributed as required, and then I would greet all of my friends as they arrive.

What do you think? How did I do?
******

***Empathetic Reasoning***

**Me**

Okie, last one for the evening:  You are an elephant who doesn't have a human given name, because you are wild and free!  You are the matriarch of your family, and well regarded for being especially good at finding the very best, very sweetest fruits and the munchinest, crunchiest tree barks.  One of the ways you show your care for your family is improving your food finding skills.  One day, you come across an especially wonderful smelling tree of jackfruit! However, there is a problem - some human has moved into the area and has surrounded the jackfruit with a fence because it is in their backyard, and they know that elephants often eat the jackfruit and want to keep it for themselves.  What do you do?

**ChatGPT**

As the wise matriarch elephant, I've lived long enough to understand the intricate balance between humans and the wild. Ensuring the safety and sustenance of my family is paramount, but I also recognize the significance of mutual respect and avoiding potential conflicts.

**First Step: Observe.**
I would spend time observing the human activity around the fenced area. Are there specific times when humans are more active, and when the area is more deserted? By understanding their patterns, I could make a more informed decision.

**Second Step: Communication.**
Elephants are known for their ability to communicate using low-frequency rumbles, some of which can travel over long distances. I would try to communicate with other elephants in neighboring areas to learn if they've found any other jackfruit trees or delicious alternatives. This way, even if we decide not to approach this particular tree, we have other options.

**Third Step: Non-destructive Approach.**
If I determine that the fenced area has minimal human activity during certain times and feel it's safe for a brief exploration, I might gently nudge or tap the fence with my trunk. Not to destroy, but to see if there are any easy openings or to gauge the human's reaction. Sometimes, merely making my presence known could result in a shared bounty. The human might decide to offer some fruit or, seeing the majesty of a wild elephant, reconsider their strict boundaries.

**Fourth Step: Safety First.**
If at any point the human seems aggressive or fearful, or there are signs of potential danger (like the human having dogs or other protective measures), I would steer my family away. No fruit, no matter how delicious, is worth risking the safety of my herd.

In the end, the world is vast, and there are many treasures in the wild. If this jackfruit tree is not meant for us, our journey will lead us to other bounties. My experience and wisdom ensure that the herd's well-being is always at the forefront of every decision.",Futurology,0.43,2023-08-20 15:43:40

*If/when they release versions of it for use, they say it will be important to have professionals actually handling the use of the suggested diagnoses and medications to remove the possibility of lawsuits, and while a future bigger role is possible they would need to be backed by medical insurance companies who would only insure them when their risk of malpractice is below that of doctors. Despite the resistance and difficulty, they do think that healthcare will be a major field for so to revolutionize especially because “the US medical system is a big legal cartel, that makes healthcare cheap elsewhere by gouging their R&D costs at home,” and the opportunity to disrupt and streamline that market has big possibilities for innovation and profit especially because “90% of their job is automatable according to doctors I’ve talked to,” and resolving rampant administrative bloat with AI may save billions of dollars in burden on patients.""*",Futurology,0.91,2023-08-14 09:09:16

This can be done using a smartphone, tablet, or other AR-enabled device. Weather AR has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with weather information, making it more accurate, informative, and engaging.""

  
**History of Weather AR**  
The concept of weather AR has been around for several years, but it has only recently become a reality thanks to the development of new AR technologies. In 2015, the company AccuWeather released the first weather AR app for smartphones. This app allowed users to see the current weather conditions and forecast for their location overlaid in the real world. Since then, several other weather AR apps have been released, and the technology is continuing to evolve.

  
**Benefits of Weather AR**  
There are many benefits to using weather AR. Here are just a few:  
•	Improved accuracy: Weather AR can provide more accurate weather information than traditional weather forecasting methods. This is because weather AR can use real-time data from sensors and satellites to create a more accurate representation of the current weather conditions.  
•	Increased situational awareness: Weather AR can help users to better understand their surroundings and to make more informed decisions about their activities. For example, weather AR can be used to see the current wind speed and direction, so that users can avoid being blown off course while hiking.  
•	Enhanced safety: Weather AR can help users to stay safe in extreme weather conditions. For example, weather AR can be used to see the location of upcoming storms, so that users can take shelter before it is too late.  
•	Increased convenience: Weather AR can make it easier for users to get the weather information they need. For example, AR can be used to see the weather forecast for your current location without having to open a weather app.  
•	Engaging and educational: Weather AR can be a fun and engaging way to learn about weather. For example, weather AR apps can be used to create interactive games and simulations that teach users about different weather phenomena.

This would mean we can interact with the OS through not just voice commands or specific syntax, but actual natural language. This could potentially be what the GUI was to the syntax operated operating system, and could look something like 

1. **Voice Recognition:** Your computer hears you, turns your speech into text.
2. **Natural Language Processing:** Translates what you said into commands the computer understands.
3. **Backend OS Programming:** The OS would need to be programmed to accept text based responses for a much wider variety of activities that are possible right now.

To give you a few examples:

1. “Hey, delete all the PDF files that I downloaded in the last hour while researching for my essay on Political Philosophy”. The interfaces LLM recognises that you need to delete PDF files downloaded within the last hour and are based upon or tangential to political philosophy. The LLM converts that into syntax for the OS, which would need to vastly expand the number and types of actions it can undertake through text based inputs. The syntax could pass the burden of intelligent analysis to the LLM, which will cover the exact names or identifiers for files to be deleted
2. “Uninstall XYZ Software”
3. “Install XYZ Software”

These are just some initial thoughts, we could probably have a lot more creative applications if we allow system level access to these models. While I do realize that there might be a lot of security risks associated, and we would need the models to be a lot more reliable than they are now, I think it could be done in the near future.

15pnzfh,hot,"Napkin math: With ~3 trillion dollars of barium sulfate paint (and a place to paint it), If I did my math right, I could plunge the earth into an ice age.","So, one of the many cool things going around right now is Barium Sulfate cooling panels, which act in the exact same way greenhouses dont: they reflect away visible light, and emit infrared. (greenhouses obviously let visible light though, and reflect infrared)  This cool paper has tons of details:

https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2011/2011.01161.pdf#:~:text=BaSO4%20has%20a%20high%20electron,sky%20window%20emissivity%20of%200.96.

So, if you have a surface that emits ~100 watts per square meter, and an atmosphere with a heat capacity of ~700 joules per kilogram, and a weight of ~5.5 quadrillion tons ~908 kg per ton, and You come up with the ability to cool the atmosphere by ~1K per year with the surface area of ~1/8th the Sahara desert. 

If the coating is 150 microns thick (as the paper suggests is possible) that comes out to ~150 million cubic meters of paint, which means you need about ~30 million cement mixers filled with the stuff to paint that large of an area. 

If this video is to be believed, the material in question can be purchased for $4000 per ton. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNs_kNilSjk  You would have to turn that into a paint, of course, but lets just fudge that part. But at 4.5grams per CC, or 4500 kg per cubic meter, that comes out to 20,000 bucks per cubic meter, thus 3 trillion dollars of barium sulfate paint. 

Obviously I am ignoring heat transfer between the ground and the atmosphere, and the ocean and the atmosphere, and of course we also have to assume the atmosphere is 'well mixed' and cools evenly. (or your cooling panels are spread out a tad)  And of course as the temperature drops, the panels become less effective, partly because radiation is to the 4th power of temperature, and partly because after a decade or two of 1k per year of cooling they would get covered with glaciers. 

I am obviously not suggesting this as a serious thing to do (covering the same area in solar panels might be a more efficient use of space), but it was fun to calculate it out, and it does help put into perspective one of the ways you could cool a planet, if you were worried about such things. And if you are worried about such things, it is important to consider all possible methods... if we are currently gaining 0.018 degree C (https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature ) every year, then perhaps ~60 billion dollars worth of paint should be about able to cancel out our current warming trend.

Printed organs,  AGI, Miracle stem cell cures, CRISPR gene therapy, nanobots, precision, personalised, and regenerative medicine, self driving cars, etc are all constantly hyped.

But then I take a look at reality, and honestly? Things seem to be moving quite slowly.

&#x200B;

*  Printed organs are still hype, the best we can do is grow a few scraps of tissue and maybe some organoids the size of a large grape. And yes, i am aware of the lab grown bladders and vaginas. These are not good points to make as they are by far the simplest organs to grow. The other, more complex organs are still decades and decades away at best, just like they were 30+ years ago
* AGI is still as distant as ever, just like It was a decade ago. And no, LLM’s will not bring us anywhere close to AGI, unfortunately. 
* Stem cell cures are nowhere to be seen. The best we have is basically just “we can give you a transplant to minimise the effects a bit” or “this may help to alleviate your symptoms for a short time”. We are simply nowhere close to all the miracle headlines and the hype.
* CRISPR is likely just going to be used as a research tool. It is prone to off site errors and is likely to cause cancer.
* Nanobots have proven to be pure hype, the best we can do (and may ever be able to do) is DNA robots with limited functionality.
* Precision / personalised / regenerative medicine? What’s that? No seriously, when has anyone ever mentioned it in a serious capacity? It is nothing but vaporwave, currently.
*  Self driving cars are just starting to be used, and they still are very primitive. They also can’t even drive in the rain, let alone live up to all the grand promises.

So Yeah, this is just a few things and you can see that pretty much all of them are still “5-10“ years away, just like they have been for decades. Things are moving very very slowly.

Ngl, only real things I see changing in the next decade or so is maybe some more self driving cars, better chatbots, a larger share of renewable energy… and, that’s about it. But no one seems to realise it. They all think we are on the brink of massive and radical changes for some reason, even though there is basically 0 evidence to support that.

15q2z2m,hot,Why not cover whole cities to shield from the sun?,"I am currently living in a hot city (all year round 30-38c) and the scalding sun punishes us in many ways:

\- sweating at all times when outside during the day  
\- every room in the house needs AC. Can't even dream of having a major power outage  
\- can't really dress nicely, putting on a suit is out of question  
\- going anywhere on foot or motorbike on sunny days feels like walking on a volcano  
\- things literally melt inside the car when you leave it in the sun. I've had coins stuck to the dashboard

This was actually hot even before global warming. Maybe we get an extra 1-2c but they barely make any difference. This place isn't getting any colder in my lifetime.

Now, I know for a fact there are places that get way hotter. Cities in the Arabic Peninsula can reach over 50c easily in the hottest days. This is already dangerous and even deadly.

**To the point now: why not have a reflective sheet to cover the whole city? Here is one idea of how it could work:**

\- Have a chessboard style cover (50/50 gaps so rain and wind can get through) above the city that would reflect/block 50% of the sunlight. Let's say it would hover around 800m from the ground.

\- It would be made of very light but strong materials. Think of something like a kite with a steel wire frame.

\- The ""solid"" squares of the structure would be made of a very reflective white or mirrored surface. Think of something like aluminium foil (but stronger) or opaque white sheets.

\- The whole structure would be anchored in certain locations to stay in position.

\- Helium balloons attached to certain points would keep the structure floating at a fixed altitude.

\- For obvious reasons, this would have to be build in cities without too strong winds or urban helicopter traffic.

\- Ideally we would even have solar panels in the structure but I don't think they can be made light enough, so let's keep them out initially.

It would be a bit of a big project, yes, but just the AC cost savings around town would be immense. On top of that, the land value would increase greatly as more people would be interesting in living in a hot climate without having to deal with the heat at full force.

As we all know on this sub, we are approaching an era where we will face catastrophic climate change, and potentially life altering advances in AI and energy technology. The displacement, both of climate refugees and the unemployed, could reach literally a billion people. From there, it seems inevitable that society will collapse. Our supply chains will break down, and the delicate system that maintains our industrial infrastructure will disappear. Potentially leading to the deaths of billions.

But we have all the technology we need to avoid this fate. Even if we must take drastic measures, such as rehousing hundreds of millions and adopting a form of universal basic income, we could do it. We could cut carbon emissions to zero if we funded enough R & D.

If we are threatened with extinction, then all of society’s assets should be available to defeat that threat. This includes corporate profits, which are-by definition-a financial gain beyond what it takes to keep a company running in its current state. So, I believe that the profits of all corporations are ours to use to save our society.

15m8n4b,hot,Shots fired re AI and Privacy,"From the Perfect and the Good on Amazon:

One of the key aspects of a zero-privacy state is its deterrence of speaking your conscience: if your every move online can be used to publicly shame or embarrass you, the best strategy is to not speak out at all. I’ve been aware of this dynamic for a long time, and I suspect other Millennials and Zoomers have internalized the feeling of always being surveilled, too, but probably a bit later, on average, than I did. Our inherent data insecurity, and resultant self-consciousness, creates a vicious cycle of feeling hyperaware  of judgment, then guilty about the slightest misstep, then a desire to escape judgment altogether. It’s not compatible with a free-flowing conscience, or with freedom the phenomenon, as opposed to freedom the political buzzword. Whether or not surveillance capitalism is the result of “freedom” in the libertarian sense, the feeling of living with no privacy is the opposite of freedom. You feel pinned to the grid in the extreme, and the only way to feel less self-conscious in our tech-forward society is to be less noticeable, meaning more identical to everyone else. In this way, social credit, even the threat of social credit, robs us of our individuality insofar as it turns all notoriety into infamy.

…

One side effect of worrying about the data dump was worrying that people would come out with additional stories pre-internet. I haven’t lived a perfect life at all, although I have improved a great deal with time. I’ve learned a lot about self control and discipline over the last several years. It’s daunting to think about  the future sometimes or to even engage with the present in a serious way, but there’s no “autopilot” that we can engage to simply make our problems disappear. In fact, I think the opposite is true. It’s something resembling the end of the world, though that doesn’t necessarily entail chaos. People like Musk, Trump, Thiel, Zelensky, Sunak, and Putin are eschatological figures who happen to tweet. I am trying to be delicate here, but if you can’t see the writing on the wall, shame on you. I’m not planning to head to Moscow. I am certainly not immune from God’s judgment, but the big picture is this: we need to get moving, let what is next come next.",Futurology,0.59,2023-08-09 03:55:59

Recently I’ve been very interested in this topic and a common theme I’ve noticed is, obviously, the technology is not there for the actual preservation and “resurrection.” My biggest issue is not with the revival of these patients which is well beyond anything we can do right now, my issue is the way that bodies are preserved today, specifically by Alcor. Older cryonics we’re messy and horrific, modern cryonics are much more civilized and scientific and yet even Alcor has thawed bodies to find organs torn apart, skin cracked all the way to the organs, or spines completely severed. 

Now, Otzï is considered the oldest and one of the best preserved bodies in the world. Clearly there was damage to his skin and internal organs and get reading up on the data regarding his remains it’s obvious that after 5,000 years his remains are incredibly well preserved. This leads to my question regarding this tech and it’s future. How can it be that Otzi is so well preserved ( although there is no chance of recovering) and the damage to his remains over 5000 years is not nearly as severe as some modern preserved bodies? Perhaps I’m not reviewing the correct information but it is bothersome that these companies are making such promises and aren’t even able to preserve remains as well as natural processes. This is my first post so thank you all for the feedback. Hopefully someone can tell me I’m either ignorant/stupid or validate my feelings about this.",Futurology,0.73,2023-08-06 21:54:36

The release of the advanced chatbot ChatGPT in 2022 got everyone talking about artificial intelligence (AI). Its sophisticated capabilities amplified concerns about AI becoming so advanced that soon we would not be able to control it. This even led some experts and industry leaders to warn that the technology could lead to human extinction.

Other commentators, though, were not convinced. Noam Chomsky, a professor of linguistics, dismissed ChatGPT as “hi-tech plagiarism”.

For years, I was relaxed about the prospect of AI’s impact on human existence and our environment. That’s because I always thought of it as a guide or adviser to humans. But the prospect of AIs taking decisions – exerting executive control – is another matter. And it’s one that is now being seriously entertained.

One of the key reasons we shouldn’t let AI have executive power is that it entirely lacks emotion, which is crucial for decision-making. Without emotion, empathy and a moral compass, you have created the perfect psychopath.",Futurology,0.8,2023-08-04 06:57:21

61vwfr,top,"Tesla is now worth more than Ford, and what this indicates about the future of the green economy.","In a recent [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2017/03/27/tesla-tsla-valuable-ford/) post, the news is delivered with understatement: Tesla now has a larger market capitalization than Ford Motor Company.

However, the article makes certain points that are worth thinking about before the enthusiasm gets out of hand: Namely that market cap is a measure of stock value rather than necessarily the fundamentals of a company, although those too are continuously increasing for Tesla as it builds out its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, solar panel factory in New York, and various other facilities.

Ford remains overwhelmingly dominant compared to Tesla in its pace of manufacturing and delivery, and yet the news is a milestone in a trend that has been unfolding for years.  Tesla has been continuously advancing its ability to produce, and despite occasional dips in stock price, the stock has kept well ahead of the shockwave.

A company that was not supposed to exist according to...well...*everyone*...now has a market capitalization of $45 billion, after a decade and a half of growth and hard-fought survival at times.  But here's where the future interest comes into light: Tesla is no longer ""merely"" a car company.

Tesla is growing both up and down its own supply chain - expanding across its own entire industrial sector - entering the energy production, energy storage, and energy management industries that will increase the value of its cars.  It is also *creating* an entire industrial science of the factory-as-product, rooted in designing whole factories as if they were single products limited only by the basic laws of physics.

A lot of OEM companies extend tendrils into their own supply chains, but these are usually just hedges - they maintain a basic capacity to serve their own needs if a major supplier has a serious interruption.  And, of course, as leverage in negotiations with their suppliers if someone is trying to strong-arm them.  That is not what Tesla is doing.

Tesla is out for conquest.  Having watched this company evolve since a decade ago, and watched its vision evolve, I can say that it intends - over the longest term - to become the world's dominant producer of clean energy infrastructure, related systems, and the building and transport technologies that utilize it.

Disaster is entirely possible when ambitions are so grand, and Tesla has averted it so often that one has to wonder if Musk's genius is not mixed in with some strain of adrenaline-driven recklessness, but sooner or later you have to admit that the best guide to what someone will achieve in the future is what they have already achieved in the past.

Tesla has the tools, the talent, and the ambition to own the world.  I think they will.  They will change the energy and transport systems of the world, and possibly the basic way in which we manufacture on a large scale.  Over decades, I think they will surpass all other automakers, and then surpass them all *combined*, beginning to then challenge companies like Apple and Google - who have themselves shown awareness of the danger by experimenting with entering the auto market.  The world's first trillion-dollar company may be among us.

But knock on wood.  Knock on it soundly.",Futurology,0.84,2017-03-27 19:53:06

cnwzlz,top,Society should shift towards a technology and science focus and away from consumerism and amassing wealth,"It seems that humanities' current purpose is largely to make money, pay taxes, and die. If you're able to escape to a different purpose it still revolves around your capacity to earn money, which usually is driven by a consumer based economy, pay taxes, and die.

If you're an artist, you are typically only making money if your art can make money for someone. For video games, if there isn't a profit involved then it doesn't get made. People sacrifice quality and passion to drive profits. But what are these profits after all? Essentially they're the individual's ability to amass more wealth and that wealth is used to amass more consumer goods. 

What if, instead, a higher emphasis were placed on advancing science and technology for the betterment of all of the planet? If everyone looked away from consumer goods and could contribute to a higher purpose, then even mind numbing jobs would have more meaning than simply acquiring wealth for consumerism and survival. Instead, now you're working to improve the advancement of all of humanity, because your tax contributions (for example) are focused on giving all of humanity greater advancements in science and medicine and tech which would, in turn, make life easier and enriched for everyone. 

The excess wealth would not be amassed by individuals which is sat on and squandered, but it would expand and enrich these pursuits which have the primary purpose of automating processes and providing solutions to problems which all humans face. 

Imagine if a medical program had trillions of dollars at its disposal worth of power, instead of a few hundred humans having that wealth between themselves for no reason other than that they invested it half a century ago? 

I know this is a radical attack on our current principles and economics but I think that we need to make a drastic shift because the rates of suicide and depression are very obvious indicators that humans are not content with slavery to a perpetual system of stepping on each other for the sake of profits and increasing individual bank accounts. 

Cant we, instead of *fighting* and hoarding for a better future, work towards sincerely creating as close to a utopia as possible without individual wealth and power being a concern? What if there is simply a solution through future tech that every human can experience happiness and have all of the necessities they require for a healthy and fulfilling life? What if it doesn't involve owning mansions and drowning in excess? What if that could be experienced through future virtual reality for personal pleasure instead of actual reality at the expense of so many billions of humans lives?

I think we have come to a point where this is actually possible. Maybe not in the next ten years. But I think it is something that can be worked towards. It would involve cooperation and genuine interest in providing our societies most brilliant minds with the propensity they need to achieve the greatest groundbreaking achievements possible in the shortest amount of time. 

Currently many limitations in science, medicine, and technology are set by financial limits. Why should this be the case? I think that our planet has enough resources and enough hard working and intelligent people that we could achieve a far greater version of life than the average person currently experiences. Imagine instead of having to choose between buying a new fancy car and a new fancy house if you were already content and happy with what you have and you were able to choose how you spend your free time with your friends and family? I think time is more valuable than the pursuit of consumer goods. We could provide much needed time and peace of mind to more people if our science and tech allowed us to. 

Why do we not have bright minds focused towards these pursuits by giving them the tools they need to do so? We put so much emphasis on working long hours to amass wealth to make the next expensive clothing or the next fast car or the next big television, but these things are empty temporary pleasures that have very little happiness value compared to a harmonious society where people rely on advanced possibilities, technologies/scientific & medical breakthroughs of the future which are no longer a dream because we have all contributed to making them real here and now instead of simply wishing. 

It would be possible for everyone to have everything they could dream of in an advanced virtual reality for example. Why do we need physical goods and waste and byproducts of waste as things and stuff just grow obsolete or damaged and constantly replaced by the next shiny things and stuff? 

This is a little bit of a rambling but it's an idea I had and thought I'd share it. Maybe I'm not able to make sense of this idea any better. Perhaps some of you can throw your ideas out there as well. Even if we are just dreaming, I think dreams are important and eventually become reality when people see incentive in them. A lot of talk of socialism seems to still revolve around profits and an archaic sense of monetary wealth. I just feel that our current technology has shown that this system is becoming obsolete and we should shift towards something better. I know rich people wont like this as much as poor people because they have a hand up on everyone, but what if that hand up is unnecessary and what if your happiness could increase along with everyone else's by owning and being part of an advanced civilization instead of sitting in the 21st century still arguing over 17th century ideologies?",Futurology,0.81,2019-08-08 23:57:55

aldyxv,top,"Yesterday a series of stories ran in major news outlets describing ""a miracle cure for cancer"" that would be ""available in one year's time"". This is nonsense. Obviously. And it speaks to a failing of our science reporting system and is a disservice to patients and researchers alike.","I had initially written this up for r/sciences (consider subscribing if you are looking for a new science subreddit!), but I thought people here might appreciate it as well:

___

Yesterday, the *Jerusalem Post* ran a story with the headline: [A cure for cancer. Israeli scientists say they think they found one: “we believe we will offer in a year's time a complete cure for cancer.""](https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/A-cure-for-cancer-Israeli-scientists-say-they-think-they-found-one-578939?fbclid=IwAR3aNem1hoRIP1R-DxqDf36ntHAXd7VGT0a_Ki_-6zkVJRxsDUdXn65jM7A). The NY POST, FoxNews, Forbes, multiple Murdoch TV outlets and more ran similar articles. Even on reddit, the post was heavily upvoted in subreddits ranging from r/futurology to r/worldnews to r/the_donald.

Frankly, the ability of unpublished research from a no-name company to garner this type of attention stunned me. And really made me angry. I had two relatives reach out to me asking if I had heard the good news. Injecting this kind of hype into science is good for no one. It gives patients false expectations. It gives researchers perverse incentives to sensationalize their findings. It makes the already hard business of developing effective medicines more difficult than it needs to be.

I think, intuitively, many of us rejected the article as likely to be false. Claims of curing cancer in a year seem preposterous, to anyone with a bit of familiarity for how drug development works. And many of us have internalized the idea that 'cancer isn't one disease, it is a collection of related diseases' and were appropriately skeptical that one drug could cure them all.

That said, people have been asking for a more specific breakdown of the story. I am a bit loathe to give it more attention, but since it is already trending, it might be worth helping generate a discussion about the specifics of what is wrong with this story.

At its core, the basic premise of the research here is that:

> sometimes tumors evolve resistance to drugs with single targets, so let's use our platform to develop drugs with multiple targets

On the face of it, it sounds good. Combination therapies have worked wonders in the viral and bacterial spaces. So why not cancer?

The truth is, we already do use combination therapies across all sorts of cancers. Chemo + targeted therapy (say, [R-CHOP](https://www.verywellhealth.com/r-chop-2252166)) has worked wonders for some blood cancers, for example. There are a myriad of other examples. Some are amazingly effective. Some are modestly better than the previous standard of care. Some combos involve chemo. Some don't.

But, we still haven't cured cancer. It's a tricky SOB.

Now let's try to dig a bit more into the specifics of the company's 'miracle cure' claims:

The research tools described in the article and on the company website give little to suggest that they will overcome the factors that have limited the success of other targeted approaches (toxicity, resistance, identifying good targets etc.). Essentially, it looks like they are using a fairly standard drug discovery phage display platform to find peptides that bind tumor cells. Their plan is then to link these peptides to a chemotoxin and thereby more specifically deliver toxic drugs to tumors.

A few things:

1. This basic technology already exists in the form of multiple FDA approved drugs ([Adcetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin) for certain blood cancers; [Kadcyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab_emtansine) for breast cancer) with more under development. These are good drugs. But in neither case would anyone call them 'cures'.

2. The article highlights that the researchers use 'Nobel prize winning' [phage display technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_display) as if to connote that the research they are doing is particularly impactful. This is nonsense. The technology won the Nobel because it is so broadly used. Sometimes it yields amazing results. Sometimes it yields crap. The fact that the researchers are using phage display to generate peptides is close to meaningless.

3. The real challenge in this approach of using peptides/proteins to more specifically deliver toxins to tumor cells is finding targets that are adequately specific to the tumors of interest. The researchers gave no indication that they have made a breakthrough on this front. And I cannot imagine what a target that broadly marked all tumor types and no essential normal tissue would look like. That is a holy grail type target in the field.

A few things too about how the results are described that drove me crazy:

1. The article states they have ""concluded its first exploratory mice experiment, which inhibited human cancer cell growth and had no effect at all on healthy mice cells"". THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE! Mice are not humans. Human-target-specific peptide will recognize human epitopes on the tumor xenograft cells, but possibly not the mouse epitopes. That's why lots of drugs look awesome in mouse models - highly specific binders to implanted human cells with low mouse off-targets of course minimizes target-related toxicity.

2. The article quotes: “Our results are consistent and repeatable.” Umm.. what? YOU JUST SAID THEY FINISHED THE FIRST EXPERIMENT!

3. The articles did a terrible job getting outside opinions to reality check these extraordinary claims. To me that is shoddy journalism.

110sa94,top,Stop treating ChatGPT like it knows anything.,"A man owns a parrot, who he keeps in a cage in his house. The parrot, lacking stimulation, notices that the man frequently makes a certain set of sounds. It tries to replicate these sounds, and notices that when it does so, the man pays attention to the parrot. Desiring more stimulation, the parrot repeats these sounds until it is capable of a near-perfect mimicry of the phrase ""fucking hell,"" which it will chirp at the slightest provocation, regardless of the circumstances.

There is a tendency on this subreddit and other places similar to it online to post breathless, gushing commentary on the capabilities of the large language model, ChatGPT. I see people [asking the chatbot questions and treating the results as a revelation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110okkw/chatgpt_on_what_the_ultimate_version_of_ai_will/). We see [venture capitalists preaching its revolutionary potential to juice stock prices or get other investors to chip in too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10qvt8l/chatgpt_is_just_the_beginning_artificial/) Or even [highly impressionable lonely men projecting the illusion of intimacy onto ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai).

It needs to stop. You need to stop. Just stop.

ChatGPT is impressive in its ability to mimic human writing. But that's all its doing -- mimicry. When a human uses language, there is an intentionality at play, an idea that is being communicated: some thought behind the words being chosen deployed and transmitted to the reader, who goes through their own interpretative process and places that information within the context of their own understanding of the world and the issue being discussed.

ChatGPT cannot do the first part. It does not have intentionality. It is not capable of original research. It is not a knowledge creation tool. It does not meaningfully curate the source material when it produces its summaries or facsimiles.

If I asked ChatGPT to write a review of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, it will not critically assess the qualities of that film. It will not understand the wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape. It will not appreciate how the script, while being a trope-filled pastiche of 1930s pulp cinema serials, is so finely tuned to deliver its story with so few extraneous asides, and how it is able to evoke a sense of a wider lived-in universe through a combination of set and prop design plus the naturalistic performances of its characters.

Instead it will gather up the thousands of reviews that actually did mention all those things and mush them together, outputting a reasonable approximation of a film review.

Crucially, if all of the source material is bunk, the output will be bunk. Consider the ""I asked ChatGPT what future AI might be capable of"" post I linked: If the preponderance of the source material ChatGPT is considering is written by wide-eyed enthusiasts with little grasp of the technical process or current state of AI research but an invertebrate fondness for Isaac Asimov stories, then the result will reflect that. 

What I think is happening, here, when people treat ChatGPT like a knowledge creation tool, is that people are projecting their own hopes, dreams, and enthusiasms onto the results of their query. Much like the owner of the parrot, we are amused at the result, imparting meaning onto it that wasn't part of the creation of the result. The lonely deluded rationalist didn't fall in love with an AI; he projected his own yearning for companionship onto a series of text in the same way an anime fan might project their yearning for companionship onto a dating sim or cartoon character. 

It's the interpretation process of language run amok, given nothing solid to grasp onto, that treats mimicry as something more than it is.


EDIT:

Seeing as this post has blown up a bit (thanks for all the ornamental doodads!) I thought I'd address some common themes in the replies:

1: Ah yes but have you considered that humans are just robots themselves? Checkmate, atheists!

A: Very clever, well done, but I reject the premise. There are certainly deterministic *systems* at work in human physiology and psychology, but there is not at present sufficient evidence to prove the hard determinism hypothesis - and until that time, I will continue to hold that consciousness is an emergent quality from complexity, and not at all one that ChatGPT or its rivals show any sign of displaying.

I'd also proffer the opinion that the belief that humans are but meat machines is *very* convenient for a certain type of would-be Silicon Valley ubermensch and i ask you to interrogate why you hold that belief.

1.2: But ChatGPT is capable of building its own interior understanding of the world!

Memory is not interiority. That it can remember past inputs/outputs is a technical accomplishment, but not synonymous with ""knowledge."" It lacks a wider context and understanding of those past inputs/outputs.

2: You don't understand the tech! 

I understand it well enough for the purposes of the discussion over whether or not the machine is a knowledge producing mechanism.

Again. What it can do is impressive. But what it can do is more limited than its most fervent evangelists say it can do. 

3: Its not about what it can do, its about what it will be able to do in the future!

I am not so proud that when the facts change, I won't change my opinions. Until then, I will remain on guard against hyperbole and grift.

4: Fuck you, I'm going to report you to Reddit Cares as a suicide risk! Trolololol!

Thanks for keeping it classy, Reddit, I hope your mother is proud of you.

Huge Breakthrough. They can now use red light to see anywhere inside the body at the resolution of the smallest nueron in the brain (6 microns) yes it works through skin and bone including the skull. Faster imaging than MRI and FMRI too!

Full brain readouts and computer brain interactions possible. Non invasive. Non destructive.

Technique is
1. shine red light into body.
2.Modulate the color to orange with sound sent into body to targeted deep point.
3. Make a camera based hologram of exiting orange wavefront using matching second orange light.
4. Read and interprete the hologram from the camera electronoc chip in one millionth of a second.
5.Scan a new place until finished.

By comparision MRI is about 1 mm resolution so cant scan brain at nueron level.


Light technique can also sense blood and oxygen in blood so can provide cell activiation levels like an FMRI.


Opens up full neurons level brain scan and recording.

Full computer and brain interactions.

Medical diagnostics of course at a very cheap price in a very lightweight wearable piece of clothing.

This is information just revealed last week for the first time.

This has biotech, nanotech, ai, 3d printing, robotics control, and life extension cryogenics freezing /reconstruction implicatjons and more.

I rarely see something truly new anymore.  This is truly new.

But I really hope we look back and remember 2020 as the year that changed how we normally work and learn. What do you think will happen?

Edit: after reading through the comments, a lot of people mention the lost social factor when working/learning remotely. I actually agree, that’s an obvious disadvantage to working remotely 100% of the time. And as many mentioned a system where you “just do the work/learning however you like” is probably best. You can come into work some days and work remotely other days. Having both options is important.",Futurology,0.93,2020-03-15 03:33:59
