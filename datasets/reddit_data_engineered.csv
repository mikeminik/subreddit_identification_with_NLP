15j3lad,hot,"Scott Galloway predictions for the future of tech, and a whole lot more. Comments?","I found this recent YouTube presentation by NYU marketing professor Scott Galloway very thought provoking. Particularly liked the sections on income inequality, the rise of marketing targeted to the uber luxury segment, the promotion of artificial scarcity, the future of sports teams as an investment and the analysis of how the economy is skewed to benefit the old over the young. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otyoPiVAicI

The video runs an hour. Usually I play these kind of videos in the background, but, this one kept my interest all the way through. I plan on watching it again and taking notes.

Anybody else notice it? What do other Redditors think? Discussion? Comments?

There's a lot of Galloway on the internet, but this one seems several cuts above his usual presentations and podcasts.

We’ve had a Discord channel for a while, and now you can find us in the fediverse too. 

The site is built with software called Lemmy and looks much the same as Reddit. It even uses the r/subreddit naming conventions for different sections, just swapping out ‘r’ and using ‘c’ instead. The biggest difference is that alongside subscribing to these sections (subreddit equivalents) on our site, you can also subscribe to them on other fediverse sites, and their content will show up on your front page on our site, alongside our content.

Nothing will change on the r/futurology subreddit, this new site will be an extension of its existing community. We expect over time the site will be a mixture of people from the subreddit and brand new people who find us within the fediverse network.

176imdf,hot,Should we stop futuristic tech development and ban them instead for the good of humanity?,"I believe that all futuristic stuff like AI robots, self-driving vehicles, drones, etc. (other than tablets, household computers, internet, video games, and renewable energies) would all cause negative impact to most humans, even taking away jobs from humans (thus making humans obsolete and possibly make humans loose money, causing them to become homeless and hungry), injuring/killing (probably) millions or billions of humans, etc., maybe either killing off or enslaving humanity.

Spread this to the governments, not just the US government, but all governments across the world, to stop advancing the technology we already have (but not modern or historical technologies, since we shouldn't go back to living in caves).

Here's the proof:

I googled Scholastic News Futurism because I wanted to find an issue I read as a child in 6th grade. It explained to me how alien ships may not be aerodynamic as space has no wind resistance. That was a big deal for me to learn back then. 

Anyway I found a Scholastic News that was from 2022 predicting life in 2122. The predictions were pretty standard and uninspiring yet they had one where they predicted that teenagers will dance to customized music.

172059c,hot,Predicting the Arrival of AGI: A Study Underscores Its Imminent Existential Risk to Humanity,"A recent study employs economic modelling techniques to forecast the expected arrival date of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The paper projects an average arrival date of 2041, with a likely range between 2032 and 2048. The estimated earliest arrival is shockingly close—2028, a mere five years from now.

The paper also posits that humanity will come “reasonably close” to AGI by 2034, with the earliest projection being 2026—just three years away. These predictions come with a caveat that significant global conflict could delay AGI’s arrival by up to 10 years.

The study supports recent warnings about the existential risks of AGI from leading figures in the AI field like Hinton, Hassibis, and Bengio. It counters arguments from philosophers who consider the existential risks of AGI to be overblown.

Importantly, the paper suggests that the advent of AGI could very likely precede any catastrophic impacts from global warming. This leads to the sobering conclusion that AGI should be considered the most pressing existential risk facing humanity today.

Given the proximity of these timelines, immediate global action is imperative to address the challenges and risks that AGI poses to our existence.",Futurology,0.71,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4496418,culezz,2023-10-07 03:20:01,92,14,6.571428571428571,sol3 papers.cfm abstract id=4496418,papers.ssrn.com,1

>Well, the types of computers we have today are tools. They’re responders: you ask a computer to do something and it will do it. The next stage is going to be computers as “agents.” In other words, it will be as if there’s a little person inside that box who starts to anticipate what you want. Rather than help you, it will start to guide you through large amounts of information. It will almost be like you have a little friend inside that box.

16ynmea,hot,"Green Hydrogen Fans Say Damn The Blue H2, Full Speed Ahead","""...hydrogen is like water to modern industrialized economies: It touches everything, and they can’t live without it. Among other functions, hydrogen is a fuel and an input for the refining, metallurgy and pharmaceuticals industries. Global food systems also depend on fertilizer produced with hydrogen.

Hydrogen extracted from natural gas has been the primary driver of all this activity, with coal also factoring in to a lesser extent.

That is about to change as the falling cost of wind, solar, and other renewables has flipped the script on electrolysis, a known technology for pushing hydrogen gas from plain water with an electrical current.

The result is green hydrogen, a new global industry that has been drawing investor interest like honey to flies.

In contrast, so-named blue hydrogen is a public relations gimmick aimed at enabling fossil energy stakeholders to go about their business even as the planet burns.

Blue hydrogen simply refers to the same old fossil-sourced hydrogen, tricked out with carbon capture systems. It does not address the plethora of environmental issues related to natural gas extraction — including the impact on water resources — while adding another layer of impacts. Here in the US, blue hydrogen proposals have already sparked protests over new pipelines and sequestration sites, and there’s plenty more where that comes from.""",Futurology,0.73,https://cleantechnica.com/2023/10/02/green-hydrogen-fans-say-damn-the-blue-h2-full-speed-ahead/,arcticouthouse,2023-10-03 05:56:22,58,11,5.2727272727272725,2023 10 02 green hydrogen fans say damn the blue h2 full speed ahead,cleantechnica.com,1

16wxl7i,hot,"If you were to create a new system of distance measurement (to replace millimeters), what would you base it off, and why?","I've grown up with the metric system, but millimeters still feel arbitrary. They're not bad, but I wonder what we could have used instead.  
  
For example, in a hypothetical new system, maybe instead of 1 millimeter, the equivalent measurement could be 1/3 of a millimeter. This would give a little more granularity to commonly measured things. The equivalent of a meter in this new system would be 333.33 millimeters (33.33 centimeters), which is similar in length to an American foot or a Japanese shaku. Instead of walking at 4 or 5 kilometers per hour, you'd be walking at 12 or 15 \[1/3 of a kilometer\]s per hour.  
  
I've never in my life used the exact measurement of 1 millimeter for anything. It's too thick for paper or pencil tips. Too big for tiny insects. Yet it's too small for easy estimation. Nobody ever sees a thin tree branch and estimates that it's 13mm. We only use it because it's standard. We can measure with it (you can measure with anything if it's standardized), but I've never known anyone to estimate things in millimeters.  
  
If I need to estimate a small size, I can approximate 1 centimeter or 1 inch with my finger and thumb. I can approximate 30 centimeters out in front of me. I can even approximate 1 millimeter. I can't approximate 1 meter (if I try, it's closer to 90 cm, and I have never ever used the American/Imperial Yard. It's just that 3 x 30cm is just easier to approximate than 100cm is.).  
  
Art supplies deal with pen tips that are fractions of 1 millimeter. Sheetmetal can be in the realm of a few millimeters, or less than a millimeter. Glass beakers are probably a few millimeters thick. Even drill bits can be as precise as 6 decimal places smaller than a millimeter. 3D printing needs precision tighter than 1 millimeter.  
  
And to clarify: Why am I targeting the millimeter specifically? Because I believe it is the most important measurement in metric. It's the most accessible and useful. I feel as if the Micrometer and the Meter are functionally based on the Millimeter (even if that's not the order of how it happened).

I remember when I was at a political party. I was talking to one of my fathers friends about cellphones. We both agreed that the next step in communication would be cellphones in our brains or telepathic communication. That seems like an obvious progression-but then, what after that? There really is no more advanced method of communicating with other people than that of our mind power alone. There just isn’t a higher derivative.

16uvpe6,hot,Atoms and Bits ( the future?)," Something that I keep on thinking about recently is the atoms vs bits duo (physical vs digital). In our day and age, we priortize bits (digital) because it scales faster, has limitless oppurtunities, is more stimulating/entertaining and cheaper. Meanwhile the atoms (physical) is deteriorating with a lack of third spaces and climate change. Of course when you can do so much more with a computer and it is more efficient we would prefer the bits > atoms naturally and make our future predictions about how much the digital world can be scaled (living in VR, simulation, mind uploading etc..). But I keep on thinking would we feel the same if we managed to scale the physical world (atoms) as fast? Eor example, if we ever figure out how to manipulate the enviorment around us (synthetic biology), make travel possible (faster on earth and interstellar) and find ways to extend the human lifespan, then would be imagining a future where we all live virtual lives and such? I read current tech developments and it seems like alot of work is being done in both digital and physical spaces and my favorites are the ones that combine both (synthetic biology, self-driving cars, fusion, etc). Especially because the digital cannot exist without the physical. I do think the line between the digital and physical world will continue to blur but I am trying to figure out by how much? Will it go to an extreme or will it be a balance of the both by 2100? What do you think? I kind of hope we have a marvel like future where the digital world is consistenly there but the physical world stays too.

16rrp37,hot,What is the term for an emergent superintelligence that arises when minds are linked together or otherwise engaged in a unifying effort?,"It's not a hive mind as that is fundamentally different. A hive mind is a lateral expansion where each individual mind operates in a parallel capacity so that complex tasks can be piecemealed across each computational cluster. A hive mind capitalizes on redundancy rather than complexity.

This superintelligence would emerge unintentionally and isn't likely to be recognizable at first as it would be the result of being more than the sum of its own complex components. It would be analogous to how an individual neuron in a human brain is unaware of conscious self-awareness but the combination of many neurons allows consciousness and intelligence to emerge. That's a bit reductive as there are numerous components (eg, semiotics, cerebral and prefrontal cortices, etc) which are responsible for the gestalt of conscious self-awareness, but I digress.

An example of this would be similar to the rudimentary superintelligences found in The Electric State by Simon Stalenhag. In the story, people were using a neural link headset (neurocaster) to interact with a vast internetwork but in many cases, people would lose themselves in it, refusing to unplug, resulting in death from malnutrition, sleep deprivation, or a lack of self-preservation in the face of dangers. Individuals lost autonomy and regressed to acting as a single cell, collectively becoming part of the tissue of the neurocaster network where individuation gave rise to a far more complex entity, one whose machinations couldn't be understood or easily recognized by any individual ""cell"", if that makes sense.

16nk2j1,hot,The big problem with moving to clean zero-emission vehicles: poorer countries must not be left behind,"Over the years we have seen the increasing adoption of zero-emission vehicles. EVs had been around for a while and have been finally taking off in recent years, since 2017 or so, and growing faster than ever before. We've also got hydrogen, which have not achieved much penetration yet but I personally think it will eventually take off as well in a few years' time.

This is all good news and vital for a greener future. But there is a huge caveat: we cannot just expect to 'change the world' with moving to zero-emission cars on the streets of New York, Paris and Vienna.

We need this in Lagos, in Rio, in Dhaka, in Bangkok... we need the green revolution to take place in the developing or 2nd world nations. In the cities listed above for example, air pollution is very high and traffic congestion is crazy. Their populations are growing fast, as is a common theme throughout the 2nd and 3rd world.

In countries like China or Bangladesh, millions of people have been lifted out of poverty over the decades, which is good for them. But it also means that those people would 'level up' and start driving cars (instead of motorcycles or no vehicle), leading to more pollution. Combining that with rapid urban growth has been a recipe for disaster, as you can see for example in this [picture](https://nilepost.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/air.jpg) of Kampala, Uganda. So this is a cyclic problem that will keep getting worse.

The other issue is to do with EVs - they will not be as reliable in many countries that are already lacking in other infrastructure. There are often power cuts in many places, take Beirut for example, where EVs are an absolute no-no in its current state. Hydrogen would probably be best suited for these places, but it hasn't taken off anywhere yet.

I am writing this because I think this point is vital for our vision of a greener future. Zero-emission vehicles are beautifully clean, green and quiet, and really good for the world's future. But we can't get there without some serious investment in the poorer countries. If we don't do this I fear that the green car revolution will not happen at all on a global basis.",Futurology,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16nk2j1/the_big_problem_with_moving_to_clean_zeroemission/,OMG120,2023-09-20 08:29:36,101,16,6.3125,NA,NA,0

16nuj17,hot,The future is already happening,"The Copenhagen interpretation says the probability waves exist for a particle then the particle is observed which then demonstrates what it collapses as as being the actual state and the other probability waves were not the actual state and therefore no longer exist and therefore assumes what physically collapses as being exclusively ‘real’. In the many worlds interpretation it says that regardless of what collapses, potential already and always does exist.   
  
With this comes the implication that the future has already ‘happened’ in the sense that the possibilities already exist and what collapses isn’t exclusively real and that the potential is as equally ‘happening’ as what collapses (the future is already happening/ whatever can appear is always already happening). Just as the potential that appeared in the 'past', it’s not the past happened and now it’s not happening, those waves are not currently being collapsed but they still exist or are still happening so take a video for instance, you’re not watching something that has happened it’s currently happening and is always happening.  
  
If the past is not set and is still happening it can still be influenced – so take a video filmed in the past, if you had the ability of telekinesis, you could lift something up in the video and that would be what ‘happened’ in the past. If you had that ability you could influence the past and furthermore you could influence/ change the past in the future (could do something, in this case watch the video, in the future and change the past). Let’s say there is a video of an object being lifted into the air by telekinesis filmed 30 years ago, and let’s say that the person with telekinesis abilities is called person A, let’s also say I watch the video of the object being lifted but person A hasn’t watched the video and lifted the object yet and he is going to do it in the future say 15 minutes from now – something in the past has already happened because of something in the future that hasn’t happened yet.  
  
Question – let’s say we stop person A from ever watching the video such as delete the video, now he can’t lift the object in the past so the object lifting couldn’t have happened.  
There wouldn’t have been the video of the object being lifted because it only happened because person A lifted it in the future.  
  
Question – so let’s say person A did watch the video and lift the object 15 minutes from now – I can watch the video now of it being lifted even though person A hasn’t done it yet?   
Only if person A actually does/ did do it in the future – if not the object would not have lifted.  
  
Question – so the future has already happened?  
If the object was lifted then that means person A did lift the object in the future.  
  
Question - so the future is set?   
If the object was lifted that means that it did already happen even though person A hasn’t done it yet but even though the object being lifted has already happened/ appeared, the decision to do it hasn’t appeared yet because the past is only influenced when person A watches the video and lifts the object - only at the ‘time’ (point) when the decision to change the past is made is the past changed otherwise it wouldn’t of happened (past changes on a whim so to speak (not fixed)/ it’s not that the object was lifted in the past then the future is already set and person A lifting the object has already happened (is set). The object isn’t lifted until the point in the future when person A decided to do it, so it’s not that the future is set it’s because the past isn’t set, the past is still happening and so the past isn’t changed/ it’s not person A ‘changes the past’ (that the object wasn’t originally lifted then person A lifts it instead and changes something that already happened), the object being lifted is what ‘originally’ happened or the object lifting is just what is happening - there's no time between the object lifting ‘in the past’ and person A lifting it ‘in the future’/ person A ‘in the future’ lifting the object ‘in the past’ is happening in ‘real-time’.  
  
The potential for anything to collapse is always already happening. There are infinite configurations that are always happening and just one configuration even though is currently collapsed/ appearing is never set – it’s always everything.  
  
In that sense, the future is already happening but you can’t precisely predict the future (clairvoyance) you can just be aware of/ imagine the ways the particles can be configured eg. if there are dark clouds you could say there is going to be lightning but you can’t say when or where the lightning will hit but the lightning strike has already happened/ is already happening.",Futurology,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16nuj17/the_future_is_already_happening/,AlreadyAbsolute-,2023-09-20 15:45:50,31,5,6.2,NA,NA,0
16oe4iq,hot,How can we populate other planets when birthrates drop already?,"People worry about overpopulation, but when a society reach a certain stage in their developement the birthrates start to decline, most of the times below 2.1 so they cant even keep the same population. 
Most developed countries suffer from this, take a look at Japan for example. (The US and Germany, France benefit from migration)

So lets say we have a permanent base or even a city, or few big cities on the Moon or on Mars or we somehow in the far future live on Europa or even in an other solar system, or a spaceship that goes somewhere for 3 generations time. 

In theory first only the smartest, richest, selected people can go, that can actually do anything there, you wont need any avarage Joes there to waste oxigen, and probably wont there be a constant flow of immigrants like in the EU. You have X amount of people and thats all. 

Will we have a system for making babies and pay people to raise them? Won’t it screw them for life?

16o66a9,hot,How long before we stop making babies the old fashioned way?,"How long before it becomes barbaric to allow a pregnancy that originated from standard sex? Will we reach a point in knowledge and control of genetics that we will say it is immoral to not carefully engineer the DNA of a fetus? If we could guarantee through artificial manipulation that we could eliminate 90% of genetic problems and could avoid most diseases, that option would look really good.

It occurs to me that such a question will edge towards eugenics. So I ask that people be mindful of that. We are already pre-screening for certain health reasons. We are already using genetic analysis in certain places in at risk couples. It just seems like we will get better at this and will keep finding places where parents will avoid genetic problems that they know run in their family, or that their children will be susceptible to a certain gene. 

If certain diseases or genetic problems go to zero in the cohort that are doing genetic screening, and it stays at, say, 5% for the other group, people in the 5% are going to complain. They may come to realize that the genetic screening  is the best route.

That could be our first future. It may eventually lead to this. 

As knowledge of genetics gets deeper, we may start doing significant gene editing to avoid certain diseases. We can build ""vaccines"" into our DNA. Again, the most forward leaning may take that plunge, and get some disease down to 0%. Screening won't be good enough. We need to do genetic manipulation. 

This could lead to a world where people trying to have sex and then pre-screening would be looked down upon by allowing for an unacceptable construction of a genome. Our genomes must be genetically sculpted to avoid all sorts of health problems that we can control.

Nanobotts create a chained barrier.

Perhaps in the future, we'll be able to create a force field. If a force field would be possible. Do you need an oxygen supply, because that barrier would create an airtight shiel, right?

Or would there be enough molecule gaps for oxygen to penetrate and you'll be able to breathe?

With the nanobots, I'm sure there will be enough room for you to breathe.

16knr9r,hot,Is the progress of technology creating a snowball effect that we can no longer control in the future?,"**TL;DR**

Progress of technology speeds up over time while becoming more complex, we still have big problems with older technology, like climate change, nuclear power struggles and mechanics around misinformation.

So the question arises if something like AI, or any other new complex technology, will make it spin out of control.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complex technology is build on other layers of technology .

A good example is the car. It is build on various other inventions, like the wheel, the engine but also the **r**oad system.

It created an enormous amount of options for progress. More rapid exchange of materials, people, food, medicin, books.

But if we look at the road system,  when the car became in use a lot of traffic accidents happened early on since there were no traffic signs, lanes, driver licenses, sidewalks and so on. The road system invented by the romans was build for slower traffic.

The road system was adapted but traffic accidents are still the number one cause of death today for young people, the engine (and this not the main point of my post) is a source of climate change. The transport system created problems that we are still trying to solve today.

If we look at the internet as a road system, traffic was slower as well, and not as networked. There was a barrier for technology to set up services, and there was a user barrier.

The use of the internet created its own set of problems but it also progressed much more rapidly, just like the engine created much more rapid progress than the wheel and the road system, and all technologies before that.

That's because building layer on layer upon technology creates much more morefull technology, which in turn speeds up progress of new technology, this while it is getting more complex.

So the point is if we come to the point of powerfull technology like AI, and we still struggling with big problems of more basic layers of technology, like climate change, nuclear power struggles and group mechanics around misinformation,

this while technology becoming more complex and increasing more rapidly, isn't it going to turn into a snowball effect we can no longer control?

16klims,hot,Post-AI Economy & Job Satisfaction,"One theory as it relates to AI job replacement is that automation will eliminate the need for humans to work menial ""shit jobs"", most of which are found in consumer-driven/retail industries such as food, entertainment, or information processing. This might be merely a rationalization for profit-driven entities to lay off their employees, but it is nonetheless a talking point.

However, once these jobs are largely replaced, that does not solve the problem of how people will find a sufficient number of jobs that might be more (subjectively) ""meaningful"". Therefore, a new paradigm shift might need to take place with respect to how our economic system is re-composed of employment deriving from other sectors.

What would this look like? My initial idea is a transition to a state capitalist system where the government, though policy and investment, forcibly shifts the industries that dominate our GDP to large-scale projects that greatly increase the demand in areas like energy, manufacturing, resource extraction, or construction, all of which are (to an extent) more insulated from current developments in AI that threaten replacement. If left solely to the market, I don't see how this transition could take place in a reasonable amount of time before mass discontent spreads.

This doesn't guarantee job satisfaction, but employees in these burgeoning sectors can at least take solace in the fact that each of them are contributing to projects (e.g. space or mega-housing) which are serving a collective good. Added to this is the fact that these jobs would require training in specialized skill sets which would give each prospective employee a greater sense of having put their mental faculties to better use.

What are your thoughts or proposals? They should meet the two requirements of (1) employing at least the same number of people being actively displaced by AI and (2) creating jobs that give a greater sense of satisfaction than the menial service positions currently still filled by humans. Should the government play a role or do you think market forces will sufficiently reorient the workforce in a timely fashion?",Futurology,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16klims/postai_economy_job_satisfaction/,ImperatorScientia,2023-09-16 19:29:41,34,5,6.8,NA,NA,0

16k74gp,hot,What interplanetary wars might look like in the future,"So we know that planets like Mars have lots of uranium, and if we assume that the solar system is being colonized, and cities and societies are being created that do not rely on Earth for support, then this could be a fun speculation. 

For instance, we might have cities on Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Callisto, Titan, Europa, Mars, the moon, Venus and more. Certain countries on Earth like South Korea, China, the US, Russia and more would back their corresponding countries on other planets, moons, and dwarf planets with some being backed by larger players like Mars in a fight for resources.

The fourth or fifth cold war might be an interplanetary one. With these ground rules established, what would a solar system wide war look like potentially hundreds of years into the future?

Well, for starters, the major factor is distance. Earth to Mars is 6 months, Jupiter is about 5 years, Pluto is 10 years away. Other significant places like the moon and Venus are several months away by rocket and other destinations like Ceres are 1-2 years away. 

So of course, it doesn't really make sense...unless all these factions have come *prepared* for a war. 

If there's an interplanetary cold war, various places would send nuclear warheads in distant orbits around other celestial destinations. If something happens, they can press a red button, and the nuclear warhead ""unexpectedly"" collides in a target zone. Mars nukes could be ready to fire at New York City or Seöul, while the same is for *the twin cities of Spirit and Opportunity, Mars' beating heart* or the capital, *Star City*. Even areas that take 6 years to reach or more like Titan will have sent nuclear warheads to Earth, Mars, Venus, and more. Plus, the warheads in orbit around major destinations like Earth are not necessarily against Earth collectively. They could be Chinese-backed celestial destinations like Ceres sending warheads to target the USA, or American backed territories on Mars sending warheads to orbit Earth, ready to strike *New Shàng'hǎï* at a moments notice.

I would say every celestial destination would have several hundred war heads around it. A ""regular"" such destination like Ceres would have many warheads around it by various places, all trained on Vallis Aeternum, while Ceres itself has sent its warheads to a bunch of places 3 times over due to major players claiming territories, namely the *People's Republic of Mars*, China, and the USA.

16hxi2y,hot,Petty crime and Big Tech,"Petty crime and big tech

Sorry, it’s long. TLDR at the bottom. 

So I was quite intrigued a few months ago watching the Mr Who’s the Boss video about AirTags, where he explains that they talk to other Apple devices rather than transmit their own long distance signals.
I’m making an assumption therefore that all Apple devices talk to each other, and that there is a record somewhere in the phone or Apples servers that these phones interacted. 
Also assuming that people always have their mics on(let’s say they have “hey siri” on), surely this means that in our modern age, there’s a record of most petty crime being committed.
For example, if a robber robs you at gun point, there’s a record on both your phones that they were together, and that both phones recorded “give me your money or I shoot”.
I find this interesting, as it provides pretty solid evidence of soemthing happening, but at the same time is only partially good at creating an alibi, as that evidence could be faked by the robber just leaving their phone at home. 
Max tegmarks book Life 3.0 touches on this, where he asks whether humans would be willing to be survailed by the state, if tech gets good enough to deepfake us committing a crime.
Our governments already tap into our search history and phones, idk about places other than the UK and ISA, but the PATRIOT act is Orwellian, why don’t we at least use this data to help people?
So my question is: if big tech was storing our locations and mic/camera data for improvements, how come we don’t use them to track petty crime? Heck at this point, we could track insider trading, drug deals and everything else?

16gcb9k,hot,Alternative to national Universal Basic Income: the Star Trek Replicator?,"UBI (Universal Basic Income) has been tested in small communities to varying degrees of success.

Can it scale up thou?

It's clear that trying to do that is problematic when you consider the funding required at that level.

You can print money to pay people but then you cause inflation severe enough to make it enormously self defeating.

Or you can redistribute money, but to do so you'd need absurdly punitive taxes on the most productive people, thereby destroying productivity and putting your economy on a slow death march, especially if it has to compete against an unrestrained free market in another country.

However, however, however.  If you reframe the conversation and take money out of the discussion it becomes more possible.  Instead - you provide comprehensive access to goods and services at ultra low cost accessible to everyone, not just the impoverished.

To some extent, we do this already.  City water fountains are free, the ER can't turn you away, 911 doesn't charge you a fee to come, and you can send your kid to public school and there's no tuition bill.  I'm sure there are others.

But what if this also applied to food?  You walk into a grocery store, take what you want, and walk out.  No paying money.  You just get your food and go.  Then scale it up to clothes, to health vision and dental, even housing and utilities.  Robots and AI make it theoretically possible (a real life version of the Star Trek Replicator) to do without absurdly high taxes

Supposing you could do this, you still hurt the producers and workers in those markets.  You could make compromises and say gourmet food and luxury fashion still costs money while the necessities are free or almost free, but the impact on production would still be highly negative.

Still though, if suddenly people don't have bills and have all their basic needs just magically met, everyone can just focus on the top part of Maslow's pyramid, and maybe that's not such a bad trade off.

""Wave"" is not the right word here. The proper term is ""tsunami"". And by tsunami, I mean the kind of tsunami you saw when that asteroid hit the Earth in the motion picture, ""Deep Impact"". Remember that scene where the beach break was vastly and breathtakingly drawn out in seconds? That is the point where humanity is at *this very moment* in our AI development. And the scene where all the buildings of NYC get knocked over *by* that impact tsunami, a very short time later, is going to be the perfect metaphor for what happens to human affairs when that AI ""tsunami"" impacts *us*.

Here is the scene from that movie in case you forgot, or dint see it. Wow! World Trade Center... This movie is already so *old* (1998) Stupid passage of time!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNtsVP42bOE

 It may not be survivable. 

 We are on the very verge of developing *true* artificial general intelligence. Something that does not exist now and has not ever existed in human recorded history up to this point.  So if you want to vet the things that I am telling you, I'll provide some links. But we'll come to that. First, I want to explain what is *actually* going on.

 As you know, in the last not quite one year since 30 Nov 22, when GPT 3.5, better known as ChatGPT was released, the world has changed astonishingly. People can't seem to agree over how long ChatGPT took to penetrate human society. I will, for argument's sake, say it took 15 days for ChatGPT from OpenAI, to be downloaded by 100 _million_ humans. But I have reason to believe the actual time was *five* days.

And then on 14 Mar 23, GPT-4 was also released by OpenAI.

Some things about GPT-4. When GPT-4 was still in its pre-release phase, there was a lot of speculation about just how powerful it would be compared to GPT 3.5. The number was stated to be roughly 100 *trillion* parameters. The number of parameters in ChatGPT is 175 billion. Shortly after that number was published, that ""100 trillion"" one, a strange thing happened. OpenAI said, well no, it's not going to be 100 trillion. In fact, it may not be much more than 175 billion even. (It was still pretty big though, 1.7 *trillion* parameters.) This is because there had been another breakthrough in which parameters were not going to matter so much as a different metric. The new metric that was far more accurate to how the LLM model would perform was released. It was called ""tokens"". That is the, like, individual letter, word, punctuation or symbol, or whatever is input and then output. And is based on the training data required for a given LLM. It is what enables an LLM to ""predict the next word or sequence"". Like in the case of coding. (I'm not even going to address ""recursive AI development"" here. I think it will become pretty obvious in a short time.) 

The number of tokens for GPT-4 is potentially 32K. The number of tokens for ChatGPT is 4,096. That is an approximately 8x increase over ChatGPT. But just saying it is 8x more is not the whole picture. That 8x increase allows for the combination of those tokens in a manner which is probably an astronomical increase. Let me give you an analogy to better understand what that means for LLMs. So there are 12 notes of music and there are about 4,017 known chords. Of them, only *four* really matter. That combination of notes and them 4 chords are pretty much what has made up music since the earliest music has existed. And there is likely a near infinite number of musical re-arrangements of those chords still in store.

 That is what 'tokens' mean for LLMs.

And here is where it gets ""interesting"". Because that 8x increase allows for the ability to do some things that LLMs have never been able to do previously. They call it ""emergent"" capabilities. And ""emergent"" capabilities can be, conservatively speaking, *startling*. Startling emergent capabilities have even been seen in ChatGPT but particularly in generative AI image generating models like ""Midjourney"" or ""Stable Diffusion"" for instance. And now it is video. Have you seen an AI generated video yet? They are a helluva thing. Here is a sample if you haven't seen one. This is a video based entirely on prompts. The AI produced *all* of the imagery.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0EDV1HGbrc&list=FLRaQyjJEBTXrO4ffE6jfVZg&index=67&t=2s

So basically, an emergent capability is a new ability that was never initially trained into the algorithm that spontaneously came into being. (And we don't know *why*) You can find many examples of this online. Not hard to find. All of that is based on what we call the ""black box"". That is, why a given AI zigs instead of zags in its neural network node ""weights"", but still (mostly) gives us the right answer. Today we call the wrong answer ""hallucinating"". That kind of error is going to go away fairly soon. But the ""black box"" is going to be vast, *vast* and impenetrable. Probably already is.

In late November of 2022, an interesting, albeit rather obscure, paper was published.
""Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks""

https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12588 (Abstract only)

This paper was published before GPT-3.5 was released. And it actually concerns the ""cognitive reasoning"" potential of an unrelated AI language model, ""Codex"".  Still the concept of the paper is a bit of a departure from what had been. ""Chain of Thought"" (COT) and ""Program of Thought"" (POT) are two *way* different things. COT is what the model *does*. POT is how the model arrives at the outcome. Crudely it can be described as its ""thought process"". ""Few-shot"" or possibly ""zero-shot"" analogy. Yes, that sounds ""fuzzy"", because it *is*. It has huge implications. Something unsettling is beginning. We'll come back to that ""zero-shot"" business in a moment.
Very shortly after GPT-4 was released. A paper was published concerning GPT-4 with a *startling* title. ""
Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4"".


https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712 (Abstract only)

Even more startling, this paper was, in its finished form, published just short of one month after the release of GPT-4, 13 Apr 23. That's how fast the researchers were able to make these determinations.

Not too much longer after, another paper was published. ""Emergent Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models"".

https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09196 (Abstract only) 

Well. There's that word ""emergent"". This paper also concerning GPT-4 was published on 3 Aug 23. The paper describes how the GPT-4 model is able to ape something that was once considered to be unique to human cognition. A way of thinking called ""zero-shot analogy"". Basically, that means that when we are exposed to the requirement to do a task that we have never encountered before, that we use what we already know to work through how to do the task. I mean to the best of our ability. That can be described in one word. ""Reasoning"". We ""reason"" out how to do things. And GPT-4 is at that threshold *today*. Right now. And just to pile on a bit. Here is another paper from just the other day, I think. This seems to be an interesting add-on to that Nov 2022 paper. The new paper, ""When Do Program-of-Thoughts Work for Reasoning?"",

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15452.pdf

I'm amazed how fast this line of research is progressing. This paper was published in its finished form on 8 Sep 2023. Two days ago. In it they describe a way to *measure* how the reasoning capabilities of various LLMs are progressing. They call it ""complexity-impacted reasoning score (CIRS)"" Interestingly the benchmark LLM is ""ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo"". Exactly the form that I am paying a monthly fee to use on my mobile. It is an *amazing* thing. It produces coherent answers in an *instant*. As the days go by, I use it more and more often. I'm living in the freaking future! Anyway, it breaks down the differences between brute force, number crunching computation and the strange human mind-like world of reasoning.

I speculated about this in my hub essay from 2018. Yes, I'm self-quoting so I don't have to write it all out again.

>As of this commentary there is no such thing as AGI, that is ""artificial general intelligence""--A form of AI that reasons and employs ""common sense"" just like a human, to figure out how to do things it has never been exposed to before. And don't forget--That AGI will also have unimaginable computing power behind its human-like thinking. Something humans don't have--yet, maybe... And we don't even know if such a thing is possible. But I suspect that given enough processing power, speed and access to big data and novel AI computing architectures, that a narrow AI (a computing algorithm that can only do one task, but with superhuman capability) will be able to effectively simulate or mimic the *effect* of AGI. Then my question is, does it matter if it is a narrow AI simulating AGI or real honest to gosh AGI. Is there even a difference? My point being that narrow AI is very much in existence today. Consciousness and self-awareness are certainly not a requirement. And in fact, a true EI (emergent intelligence--conscious and self-aware.) would be very undesirable. We don't need that kind of competition.

That came from this.

https://www.reddit.com/user/izumi3682/comments/8cy6o5/izumi3682_and_the_world_of_tomorrow/ (2018)

The ability to reason is what would make, what we now call ""artificial narrow"" or ""narrowish intelligence"", artificial *general* intelligence. I forecast that AGI will exist NLT 2025. And that once AGI exists it is a *very* slippery slope to the realization of artificial *super* intelligence. An AGI would be about as smart as the smartest human being alive today as far as reasoning capability. Like about a 200 IQ or even a couple times that number. But ASI is a whole different ball game. An ASI is hypothesized to be hundreds to *billions* of times better at ""mental"" reasoning than humans. Further, an AGI is a *very* slippery fish. How easy is it to ensure that such an AI is ""aligned"" with human values, desires and needs? You can see what I mean now when I say ""tsunami"". What do you think that Suleyman was referring to when he said that our AI will ""walk us through life""?

Oh. And this is *also* why all the top AI experts, people like Geoff Hinton, who was the first to realize the convolutional neural network back in 2007, have called for a pause of all training for all future LLMs for at least six months. The idea being to regulate or align what we already have. He actually quit his job of chief AI tech at Google to give this warning. The warning fell on deaf ears and *nothing* has been paused *anywhere*. For two reasons. First is the national security of the USA and China (PRC) and second is the economic race to AI supremacy in the US that we are now trapped into realizing because we are a market driven, capitalist society. Hell of an epitaph for humanity. ""I did it all for the 'nookie'"". Tragically apt for a naked ape. Ironically, it is probably going to be the end of the concept of value in any event. If we don't get wiped out, we may see the birth of an AI driven ""post-scarcity"" society. You would like that, I promise. But the 1 percenters of the world probably won't. 

Anyway, Google is fixing to release ""Gemini"" which it promises to be far more powerful than GPT-4, in Dec 2023. And GPT-5 itself is on track for release within the first half of 2024. Probably in the first 4 months. I suspect that GPT-5 is going to be the first AGI, if I know my AI papers that I see even today. At that point the countdown to ASI starts. Inevitable and imminent.

And I say this--I say that ASI will exist NLT than the year 2029 and potentially as soon as the year 2027 depending on how fast humans allow it to train. I sincerely hope that we don't have ASI by the year 2027, because, well, I give us 50/50 odds of existentially surviving such a development. But if we *do* survive, it will no longer be business as usual for humanity. Such a future is likely unimaginable, unfathomable and incomprehensible. This is a ""technological singularity"" (TS). An event that was last realized about 3-4 *million* years ago. And *that* TS took about 2 million years to properly unfold. Cuz nature has all the time in the world. That is when a form of primate that could think abstractly came into being. All primates before that primate would find that primate's cognition... Well, it would basically be the difference between me and my cat. I run things. The cat is my pet. Actually, that is _vastly_ understating the situation. It would be more like the difference between us and *""archaea""*. Don't know what ""archaea"" is? The ASI will. BTW, what do you imagine the difference between an ASI and consciousness would be? I bet an ASI would be 'conscious"" in the same sense that a jet exploits the laws of physics to achieve lift just like biological birds. Who says an AI has to work like the human mind at all? We are just the initial template that AGI is going to use to ""bootstrap"" itself to ASI. There is that 'recursive AI development ""I touched on for a second, earlier. ASI=TS.

Such a thing has never happened in human recorded history.

16f2xbs,hot,How do we save humanity?,"I believe that it is evident that humans, when given authority and power, often become corrupt. As a regular low to middle-class American, I find myself increasingly confused by the multitude of perspectives and conflicting evidence that can be found on any given issue. It is disheartening to see deliberate spread of misinformation. However, I also recognize that many people tend to become entrenched in their own opinions and fail to consider alternative perspectives.

What truly concerns me is that amidst all this chaos, we are distracted from the bigger picture. It feels like we are children fighting over trivial matters while our house is burning down. I recently took a moment to hold myself accountable and asked how I personally contribute to this system. I realized that I may not possess the intelligence or understanding to fully grasp the complexities of our current situation. It is easier to let a corrupt government run things than to educate myself and take responsibility for my actions. It is easier to believe that someone smarter will come along and save us all.

However, I have come to the realization that we cannot solely rely on the government to fix our problems. We must take individual action and stop pointing fingers. While there is much that is wrong, we cannot change other people. Instead, we should focus on practical ways to help humanity on an individual basis. We need to shift our reliance away from the government and recognize that there are more of us than there are of them. Many of the changes we desire will not happen overnight, but through practical solutions and personal sacrifices, we can make a difference.

It is time to stop seeking answers solely from our government. We need to come together and find ways to make positive changes in our own lives and communities.

Like it says on the tin, what role do you think non-profits and NGOs (non-government organization) play in not only working on solutions to the problems we have now, but future-casting and helping to execute on a better/more equitable vision for the future? And are there different ways of funding projects like this than we have been, so we can work together to make more of an impact?   


I'm asking because I'm at a bit of a crossroads: a friend of mine in SE Asia just had his 5 year old son pass away due to malnutrition. Where he lives, they don't have clean water, the food isn't very nutritious, and the school he sends his daughter to is not very good, far away, and expensive.   


At the same time, I have been sitting on my ass doing a lot of reading/exploring regarding futurology, etc. So, it  just feels like an absolute dream to be able to sit on my computer and posit about the future, while they only have 3G access for their hand-me-down smartphone several kilometers from their home and not even clean water or proper plumbing.   


It just seems like a very introspective intersection that I am at, especially with the fact that I am in the founding stages of an NGO revolving around tech access for underserved areas of developing countries. Both in terms of helping to close the digital divide, but also as an upstream intervention to provide access to elearning education, telehealth, and hygiene/sanitation information.   


All this to say - as much as I have been reading about future/futurology/etc for my own life and understanding of the world, I feel like this inequity is only growing larger and that futurology is a good vehicle of helping to right a lot of those wrongs.

In the context of market self-regulation, it's actually coherent that even companies understand universal payment as necessary, since at levels of advanced automation, unemployment reaches it's peak and the population does not have the money to buy products from large companies, making a universal payment system a salvation, also generating new opportunities to create jobs based on consumerism of products and leisure

But this alone is a solution that maintains the free market and nothing more, and this explains why it's defended by a certain billionaire. Another solution would be the creation of public jobs based on maintaining the infrastructure and safety of cities, aswell as the walfare of it's citizens, in larger and more advanced stages. which are not possible today because we have not reached this level of automation, in this futuristic context, we will see a more advanced society than the one that is structured on generating new jobs and maintaining the system based solely on unnecessary consumerism",Futurology,0.42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16frvbw/opinion_how_the_free_market_will_result_in_a_new/,AstronaltBunny,2023-09-11 06:33:52,95,15,6.333333333333333,NA,NA,0

What we however consistently fail to do (very consistently) both in science fiction and in speculation about the future is actually understand how that change will happen.

For example, I read a science fiction story in which computers kept getting bigger and bigger with people eventually being able to connect to them from anywhere. The internet did happen, but the main trend has been towards miniaturization instead and we all tend to have our own computers in our pockets now.

You also have science fiction which predicts flying cars in 2015, but somehow fails to predict the omnipresence of cellphones or microwaves.

A hundred years before it happened, the idea of the computerized world as we understand it now just wasn't on anyone's radar. Let alone in the next 100 years.

This is because both humanity and technology are unpredictable. Influenced by so many factors we can't even imagine it. And neither advances in a steady, predictable way. Both in the form it will take, and in the sense that we often have revolutions in either technology (or socially) that just quickly build up and then change everything. These are so called ""black swan events.""

So here's the actual fact I'm going to lay out for you right now, rather than doomering about everything: We don't know what will happen.

We could be funding radical life extension for the next 200 years and barely make any progress, current AI technology could hit a limit and we might have to find an entirely new approach that will take centuries to find, and maybe countries all across the world backslide democratically due to climate change so badly that we're going to enter a new dark age (although it's worth noting the real dark age was not nearly as dark as usually depicted).

Or there could be a breakthrough in life extension next year. Like Darwin stumbling upon the idea of biological evolution, someone might stumble upon some fundamental component of aging that allows it to be completely controlled by humans in a decade or two. And cheaply in a few decades more. Current AI technology could prove to be even more adaptable than we think and lead us to create models that can create better models leading to a technological singularity. And instead of democratic backsliding we could end up having a renewed vigor and trust in institutions as some social and political revolution, like women's suffrage or civil rights, turns everything around.

Either future is possible. By the very nature of these things, which is that they are unpredictable because they are often revolutionary and affected by so many factors that we can't even fathom and might not even think of, they are unpredictable.

Often people who say ""get real"" just mean ""please adopt my opinion cuz I say so and I couldn't possibly be wrong."" Delusional overconfidence and ignorance of the complexity of the issue masquerading as justified confidence. And a contributor to slowing down positive scientific and social change by discouraging people and saying it's all pointless. It's somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy in that way. These things are not like predicting the weather where they just kind of happen a certain way. We all (speaking about humanity generally) have a hand in making or not making them happen. We are shaping the future every day with our decisions. And I would advise making decisions which will push the world towards being the best we can make it.

So here's my advice to everyone: We shouldn't count on ending up in a post-scarcity civilization with UBI and indefinite lifespans. But we should do our best to promote those things and push the world towards them in whatever way we can. It will increase the odds of it happening simply by trying. And even if we never get there, this will almost certainly make things better by pushing in that direction. And if we do get there, well, that'll be great too.

Whereas pointless doomering about things nobody can know will get us exactly nowhere and nothing.",Futurology,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/16ehq5w/the_good_and_bad_news_about_scientific_advancement/,OneOnOne6211,2023-09-09 17:43:14,50,8,6.25,NA,NA,0

In-Depth:
If you're on this reddit you're now aware that I must have had a more than difficult/gloomy life but also, and regularly even now, punctuated by moments of happiness as I've just said sometimes at an off-the-charts level unlike someone who would just have a quite normal life or even miserable life; from meeting a new girlfriend in a closet (I'm completely serious) to attending a ceremony for the best students in the capital, all without having made the slightest effort (compared to a so-called ""studious"" friend I saw there), I'm still really wondering if that's what intelligence is (not to be confused with knowledge), in fact a few years ago I took part in a IQ test, but not like the ones on social networks or school, there were memory tests, maths, logic questions, all on a single timer, i was the first on the list apparently, so out of humility I didn't ask for the exact number of tests carried out before mine).

As you can imagine, I won't give you any unpleasant examples from my past,non only for the presence of non-adults here, i say non-adults because in some countries at 50 you're still categorized as a child, the world is a fascinating place; but I know human curiosity (and reddit curiosity now), i'll leave you with the word ""Styx"", which is the right word to describe the worst thing that happened to me, but also what contributed to the foundation of who I am now and my actual paradigm.

16f989s,hot,Thinking Longterm - Doubts from a common person making a science table top game,"***Hello everybody, I begin by introducing the idea of the project I am working on:***

It is a table top game where the players guide their civilizations through the history of technological progress until they reach a type 1 civilization. The players will need to manage the resources on their planet for both sustaining the growth of their infrastructure while at the same time investing in newer technology. After developing it for over a year I have come to the biggest problem: the future.While we have no way of knowing what discoveries will change radically our preferences for certain types of technologies I would like to maintain some objectivity on what are our current expectations, the problem here is that energy is a very political topic, even though it is in principle a scientific subject. Therefore I have not been able to come to a consensus about how to portray energy technologies in the game, so I will give you the broad picture of what I have in mind in the hopes of gathering some evidence based opinions or even references to sites where I can find the most updated and digestible data.

* Fossil Fuels: Inexpensive, efficient, reliable and continuous. / Not Unlimited, although its efficiency has increased (needing less to do more), CO2 emitting, not unlimited.
* Nuclear Power Plants: Efficient, reliable and continuous, not CO2 emitting / Highly Expensive, Produces Radioactive waste, though not comparable to pollution generated to fossil fuels.
* Solar / Wind Farms: Not CO2 emitting (without taking into account manufacture and later disposal), expensive (depends on how refined the technology is) / Not as efficient, reliable and continuous as Fossil fuels or Nuclear. Needs for energy storage technologies which might counterweight its ecological benefits.
* Fusion Energy: Extremely efficient, reliable and continuous, not CO2 emitting / Theoretical, unknown costs, unknown viability.

**Thinking Long Term**

I have tried to research wether world wide embrace of nuclear energy would turn both fossil and ""renewable"" sources obsolete and wether it is possible, but most of the discussion is centered about the next 5 to 20 years while in my game the time scope for the future is at least 500 years.So I come to you, enthusiasts of this topic, for some opinions and directions about what the long run depares in terms of technological possibilities, without taking into account political postures or near future economical situations.

16evh24,hot,"VRChat is a great social platform to overcome anxiety, make friends, play games and party all around in the virtual space!","IMPORTANT NOTE:

*There will definitely be better VR social platforms than VRChat the platform itself in the future which will run and work much faster and better than this social game like: NeosVR or ChilloutVR but there is yet to be a challenging competitor who is willing to properly advertise, make a big step and overtake the spot of VRChat as of the writing of this post.*

***This subreddit is heavily future focused and I am trying my absolute best to be as neutral and future oriented as possible with this post it's not meant to be an ad for a certain game in mind it should just give people an idea on what to possibly do if they are struggling with social anxiety or they are just trying to make friends online to me personally VRChat has helped me overcome anxiety and grow as a person individually experience might be differ for others obviously but I just wanted to show people how heartwarming this community of VRChat actually can be and how well they work together to make things work! Bunch of Charity Events one of the biggest ones called Furality, Furchella, MendYourMind and even more!***

Even though VRChat might not be the best optimised scoial platform in it's current state (unity and performance wise speaking), it still has already become home for thousands of people!

It has even overtaken the active player spot of Second Life and is performing even better and easier to understand for newer users! The UI is simple to understand and you are not too overwhelmed with it!

A lot of people don't realise how much VR is really changing our current reality as of yet.

Once you start getting really into it, you might find it really exciting!

There is tons of games you can play inside of VRChat on Steam itself! Isn't this crazy?

On top of this you can play with your friends inside of a VR with or without full body tracking and see each other in real time! 

You don't even need a VR to begin playing VRChat in the first place! 

You can also play in Desktop mode and watch others and play with them while they are in their VR, play the game or socialising in this game!

There are tons of different games, events, parties, clubs and more!

16cn4fb,hot,Subscriptions,"I feel like this could be weirdly related to the future with the way things seem to be going. But are any of you people getting tired of this subscription stuff? I'm an IT(former military) but now on the free side. I have came into this issue that almost if not all current software and tools are all subscription based, even the Microsoft apps now. Google start charging SMBs for a workspace subscription. 

I was wondering your input on this. I'm personally starting to get tired of this. Almost every form of entertainment is subscription based now, and I'm just having a hard time spending all this money on something that will only get more expensive the more I use it. I miss the days where I can buy things and actually keep it after paying for it once. 

In the future, do you guys think this will only get more like the way its going to be now? Because even with the subscriptions and stuff I have yet see any actual successful company lower their subscription cost. Which I kind of don't understand either except for the sake of profit. If so many people are buying a monthly subscription why should it not be cheaper the more it's being bought? 

I know I'm not the smartest, but doesn't that even go against supply and demand? Software is essentially infinite supply, you can sell it quite literally infinitely without really ever needing to buy more product. I know their are dev costs and stuff along those lines, but really, once you have a finished product you can stop doing updates and just sell it for what it is. Or focus on sales to pay your people. 

I've just started to look at prices compared how many hours of labor it will take me to pay for everything now. I ain't gonna lie, with these recurring expenses it's starting to make it hard for me to even see how these subscriptions are even worth it now. Every subscription I take is atleast an hour of labor gone for the foreseeable future. Until I cancel it. And with the ways companies make you call and wait for 30 minutes just for you to cancel is messed up. 

I'm starting to see this version of gaining profit is borderline unethical and how we go about subscriptions in the future will definitely play a role of how much of a dystopia this will be.

Somehow in the 60s the US was able to devote billions of dollars towards the space race because the public was supportive of it. Why do we not put the same effort into getting the public to support anti-aging?

Quite literally the leading cause of death is health complications due to aging. For some reason there is a stigma against preventing aging, but there isn’t similar stigmas against other illnesses. One could argue that aging isn’t curable but we are truly capable of so much and I feel with the combined efforts of science this could be done in a few decades.

What are the arguments for or against doing this?

16a14s3,hot,New Doughnut and Circular Economics Are Replacing Capitalism,"[New Doughnut and Circular Economics Are Replacing Capitalism](https://www.technological-singularity.org/2023/09/04/new-doughnut-and-circular-economics-are-replacing-capitalism/)

Introduction  
Replacing Capitalism – For decades, capitalism has been the dominant economic model, driving innovation, growth, and prosperity. However, it has also led to social inequality, environmental degradation, and a focus on short-term profits over long-term sustainability (Piketty, 2014). As we grapple with these challenges, new economic models are emerging that promise a more equitable and sustainable future. Two such models—Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics and California’s Circular Initiatives—are leading the way in redefining how we think about economics.  
Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics: A Holistic Approach  
Amsterdam became the first city to formally adopt the Doughnut Economics model, a groundbreaking framework developed by British economist Kate Raworth (Raworth, 2017). The model is visually represented by a doughnut, where the inner ring symbolizes a social foundation that no one should fall below, and the outer ring represents an ecological ceiling that humanity should not exceed.  
Key Features:  
Circular Economy: Amsterdam aims to become a fully circular economy by 2050, focusing on waste reduction, recycling, and sustainable production (City of Amsterdam, 2020).  
Social Equity: The model prioritizes affordable housing, education, and healthcare, ensuring that all residents have access to basic needs (Raworth, 2017).  
Climate Action: The city has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with the Doughnut’s ecological ceiling (City of Amsterdam, 2020).  
Community Engagement: Amsterdam actively involves local businesses, residents, and organizations in decision-making, fostering a sense of collective responsibility (Raworth, 2017).  
California’s Circular Initiatives: Pioneering Sustainability  
While California has not formally adopted Doughnut Economics, it has been a leader in implementing circular economic principles (California Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). These initiatives aim to create a closed-loop system where waste is minimized, and resources are reused or recycled.  
Key Features:  
Aggressive Climate Goals: California has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy (California Air Resources Board, 2017).  
Waste Management: The state has robust recycling programs and is exploring ways to move toward zero waste (CalRecycle, 2019).  
Social Programs: California has various programs aimed at reducing social inequalities, including affordable housing and healthcare initiatives (California Department of Housing and Community Development, 2020).  
Why These Models Are Replacing Capitalism  
Sustainability: Both models prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term profits, addressing the environmental limitations of capitalism (Stiglitz, 2019).  
Social Equity: Unlike traditional capitalism, which often exacerbates social inequalities, these models aim to provide a safety net for all citizens (Sen, 1999).  
Resource Efficiency: By focusing on circularity and sustainability, these models make more efficient use of resources, reducing waste and environmental impact (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015).  
Community Involvement: Both models emphasize community engagement and collective decision-making, fostering a sense of shared responsibility (Putnam, 2000).  
Conclusion  
As we face the pressing challenges of social inequality and environmental degradation, the traditional capitalist model seems increasingly inadequate (Sachs, 2015). Amsterdam’s Doughnut Economics and California’s Circular Initiatives offer promising alternatives that prioritize both social equity and environmental sustainability (Raworth, 2017; California Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). While it’s too early to declare capitalism dead, these innovative models are certainly giving it a run for its money, pointing the way toward a more equitable and sustainable future.

I am a pro gardener and I have studied soil science and environmental chemistry at university, and I build 3D printers and ebikes, and I wish to basically make a big 3D printer with a bike motor, it's a rover with a robot arm that can dig soil, use a mini weedwacker, sow seeds using a multi-compartment seed dispenser, and various other tasks...

The difficulty is that I struggle to write my research as a science and academia publication, and industry report, and my first draft of the garden robot components, techno-economic assessment is just... 1st year university essay level. it totally isn't pro.... So please read some of the design that I wish to open source and advise me, i figure I need to hire a very literate academic to rewrite everything?

I'm using ChatGPT for phrase suggestions. it tries to write my industry report intro this way:

The contemporary technological landscape, characterized by quad-core Exynos processors boasting high RAM bandwidth, readily available computer vision libraries, affordable sensors, power-dense lithium batteries, ultrasound localization capabilities, and AI-driven object identification functionalities, presents a mature ecosystem poised to usher in a profound paradigm shift in both agriculture and domestic horticulture and landscaping. Much akin to the ongoing transformation in energy production catalyzed by the refinement of wind generator aerofoils, the current state of technology is conducive to delivering innovative solutions to domestic consumers and small-scale farms. These solutions, embodied by robots, herald a new era where traditional pesticides and extensive transportation networks become obsolete, and plastic consumption is curtailed. The result is a sustainable and cost-effective approach that enables households and small businesses to reap substantial rewards. Through the deployment of rovers equipped with economical, uncomplicated robotic arms, mechanical automation in food production can be localized and made financially accessible, effectively sidestepping the challenges of exorbitant food prices. In a manner reminiscent of how energy companies are increasingly generating power closer to consumption sites with significantly reduced waste and chemical footprints, this RnD in robotics offers the potential to revolutionize the agricultural and horticultural sectors by optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact.

168h8zc,hot,Why are we so early?,"If humanity could persist for millions or billions of years (assuming our current exponential growth) that means there will be a practically infinite number of people who will exist in the future. Yet one problem with this idea that’s always bugged me is how early in our history we are and how unlikely that is.

Current estimates figure there have been 117 billion or so people that have ever lived. A large number, but orders of magnitude smaller than what the entire human population would be at a single time in a galaxy completely colonized millions of years in the future.

My statistics are rusty so I can’t quite figure out the math, but if there were one quintillion people to ever live (a figure still small if we existed and expanded for millions more years) we would only be in the first 0.0117%. It seems much more likely that we would be closer to the middle. 

The current living 8 billion people make up 6.8% of all humans who have ever lived. Quite a larger percentage in a history spanning 200,000 years. Even if we’re in the first 1% of humans who will ever live (capping the future population at about 11.7 trillion) our exponential growth would suggest that we only have a few thousand years at the most. If we’re right in the middle we only have a few hundred.

Does this make sense or is my logic flawed?",Futurology,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/168h8zc/why_are_we_so_early/,Ok_Blacksmith_8609,2023-09-02 19:25:35,20,5,4.0,NA,NA,0
1684ah8,hot,At what point will one person have too much power?,"It's a question I've been thinking about for a while now. I always get really excited about the future, the new technologies it will bring, and the inevitable increases in energy that each person will utilize in such a society. After all, many classic scales measuring the development of a civilization is based off of how much energy that civilization utilizes.

In the past, each individual human didn't have that much power. They could use their fists, their arms, and stone tools to cut down trees and modify their surroundings. They could use their two legs to travel at a maximum speed of around 30 mph for a very short duration. Each individual human could control a few hundred watts of power at best, and generate some small scale change to their environment over a time period of a few days to weeks.

But as technology becomes more and more advanced, now each person has access to power tools, vehicles, the power to transport thousands of pounds at over a hundred miles per hour, or more with airplanes. Each person can now be on control of a few hundred thousand watts of power at a time, allowing them to unleash massive change on their environment in minutes.

It's all cool when this power is used to build and improve, but the main concern with this question comes from the destructive potential of the individual increasing as technology increases. Lets think back to the prehistoric times. If a man were to become deranged and violent, this single man might only be able to kill maybe one or two people at best with his fists or a sharp rock before he is subdued by the village. Today, this man could potentially kill tens, hundreds, or even thousands of individuals with a gun, ramming a parade with a vehicle, or flying a plane into a building, before he could be stopped. But not even from the intentional side of things, accidents involving huge amounts of power are equally as scary. Think accidental car crashes, plane crashes or even accidental nuclear launch.

This is my primary concern with the increasing technological development as society progresses. How will we be able to address the fact that as individual power consumption increases, it also introduces a greater risk of a single person being able to cause greater and wider acts of terror? Imagine in a world where everyone had access to their own spaceship, that can go 50,000 mph (governments probably will never let this happen due to the above concerns.) One deranged person is all it takes to wipe out an entire city without warning, maybe even the entire planet. This is why while I'm excited about the prospects of humanity being able to do bigger and better things with technology, it also opens up the risks of bad people being able to inflict larger acts of violence than ever before. 

Is there going to be a point where governing bodies decide that the individual has too much power and limit our overall development due to these risks? Could this be the reason why we may never have individualized civilian space travel and other cool things that require a ton of energy that I can't think of right now? Maybe in order for society to progress past this point, we'll have to find a way to completely eliminate violent tendencies from the population (unethical due to eugenics), or find a solution to death so that murder is no longer a problem (digital consciousness and revival). Bioengineering, improving the resilience of the human body so it can withstand much greater physical forces than it currently can? And what does this mean for the future of government? Is a dystopian authoritarian government and a hyper-regulated society inevitable due to the need to constantly watch every individual to make sure no one person will go rouge and kill us all?

168gphk,hot,Between Poly-Crises and the Digital Revolution,"The rapid pace at which our world is evolving sometimes feels straight out of a sci-fi novel. There's a cascade of crises, increasing geopolitical tensions, shaky financial markets, and the growing influence of the BRICS nations challenging the US dollar.   


Yet, in the backdrop, AI is quietly positioning itself as the linchpin of the fourth industrial revolution, poised to transform our job landscape.

1688trw,hot,The Future of Copyright: Making a Case for Socioeconomic Right to Educational Entertainment,"Copyright law, as it currently exists in the United States, serves to protect the financial interests of creators and distributors. While the intent is commendable, the law disproportionately affects those in socioeconomically disadvantaged situations. This paper argues that access to copyrighted entertainment materials should be considered a form of education, thereby falling under the fair use doctrine for those who cannot otherwise afford such access.  
\#### The Educational Value of Entertainment  
Entertainment is more than mere amusement; it serves as a lens through which we view and interpret the world. From understanding complex relationships through drama to becoming politically aware through satire, entertainment functions as an informal education system. Therefore, denying access to such educational materials based on financial capacity is tantamount to educational discrimination.  
\#### The Limitations of Socioeconomic Status  
The costs of legal access to copyrighted entertainment materials—through cable, internet subscriptions, or direct purchases—are beyond the reach of many Americans living in poverty. In an increasingly digital age, this lack of access further exacerbates existing socioeconomic divides, limiting opportunities for cultural and educational enrichment.  
\#### Public Benefit over Private Greed  
The intent behind copyright law is to encourage creativity for the public good. Yet, when enforcement of this law suppresses the educational and cultural enrichment of a significant portion of the population, it contradicts its own purpose. The public benefit of disseminating educational entertainment should outweigh the financial interests of copyright holders, particularly when targeting impoverished communities.  
\#### Application to Fair Use Doctrine  
The fair use doctrine allows the use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. By extending the understanding of 'educational use' to include the broad educational benefits of entertainment, those in poverty could avail themselves of copyrighted material under the protection of fair use.  
\#### Conclusion  
While copyright law serves a purpose, its blind enforcement can perpetuate socioeconomic divides and stifle educational opportunity. It's crucial to reconsider what constitutes 'educational use' under the fair use doctrine to be more inclusive and accessible for all, regardless of economic status.",Futurology,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1688trw/the_future_of_copyright_making_a_case_for/,DebianDayman,2023-09-02 13:46:06,91,13,7.0,NA,NA,0

167g5kn,hot,Why Don't the Cons of Mechs apply to powered exoskeletons?,"Would not all advantages vehicles have over mechs still apply to powered exoskeletons?

Maybe the future isn't in the exoskeleton but in the segway.  Or is there something I'm missing?

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but I am looking for a scientific answer.

I'm intimately familiar with the discussions and especially the cons brought up when it comes to mechs and vehicles with feet.  Cost, complexity, weight distribution, repair/replace, armor load, speed, and profile.  Plus treads can still overcome most obstacles and terrain issues short of a sheer drop.

But usually when I read or listen to these discussions, they say that powered exoskeletons can still work.

And sure they *can* work, but would not all advantages vehicles have over mechs still apply to power suits?  Wouldn't they still be outperformed by their more simplistic competitors?

A forklift or skid steer would be easier to build, maintain, and repair than an exoskeleton.  And if it's a heavy objects indoors where most forklifts wouldn't fit, wouldn't a tiny tiny forklift still be better?  I mean, the mariotti is effectively just a frame around a person.  Wouldn't the mariotti forklift be able to do the job of an exosuit?  I mean just look at the CTX50.

&#x200B;

And if they're still too big wouldn't it be easier to shrink existing vehicles rather than make an exosuit?

This idea that soldiers might one day wear mechanized suits to help carry a load, surely what would effectively be a motorized wheelchair could do the same.  (I'm being figurative.  I don't actually mean motorized wheelchair.  But grab an engine, some wheels, and an area to load the equipment would surely be easier than actuators for the thigh, knees, and ankles, plus a way to maintain balance.

There's this idea that an exosuit can help a soldier carry bigger guns with more ammo, but so could the gun toting segway.  (Once again being figurative).  And there's the matter or profile, just have the control be in the laying down position so that it's more like an army of tiny tanks.

Even the mobility.  The argument against mechs is that treads are perfectly capable of traversing most obstacles.  So there shouldn't be a scenario where a tiny vehicle with treads couldn't overcome.

Really the only field I can think of for exoskeletons is medicine where a person will want the feeling of walking back.  But if you want performance, wheels and treads just seem to dominate feet in all circumstances.

165udxl,hot,A path to global demilitarization. How we build better societies.,"We ask for a pledge by each nation: ""Our nation pledges to demilitarize, if all other nations demilitarize as well.""

It is an empty pledge contingent on all other nations making the pledge as well. Even then, there is no teeth. It was just a pledge. We would then have to begin new conversations, write new treaties, and begin scaling back. We would not expect the U.S. to pledge first.

I want a candidate making a protest challenge in the primary of the Democratic Party. It would be a single issue campaign focusing on getting that pledge by each nation. It would be an international campaign. We would search out small, peaceful nations first to get them to pledge.

The world does not demilitarize without all the major players doing so. I know people will scoff at Russia, but Russia should see by now they're a 2nd rate military power. If 100's of nations have pledged demilitarization maybe they begin to see that as a better future. China should definitely see this as a better future. Their strength comes from elsewhere. 

I see no reason why dozens of rather peaceful nations would not take this pledge and encourage the rest of the world to do the same. It is an empty pledge until all other nations agree. We would encourage 2/3 consent by legislative bodies. It needs to be a unified commitment. We of course want the pledge from both our friends and our enemies. Religions can push their people to such a pledge.

From there, once the world makes such pledges, we will have different conversations with each other. Empty islands in the middle of the sea become less important. Military unions become less important. Those conversations and actions would take time. It would take an end to cold wars and economic wars to gain trust between all parties.

Many people in the world would urge their leaders to take up such a cause. Hopefully, in the long run, we spend that money and time that we spent on militaries and instead spend it on building better societies and exploring our world.

Just for fun: This arose out of my contemplation of the great silence. If we are the only intelligent species, then we should be making sure we are safe and thriving. Right now, all we know is that we are the only intelligent species. Of course, greater peace is a good in its own right.

The main criticism against the experiment is that the hypothetical AI would have no rational reason to torture people who thought of it but didn't put any effort into creating it. What I don't get is, when people talk of the experiment being dangerous to disseminate, do they actually take future mind-reading as a possibility? Is that a mainstream assumption in the AI community that in the future superintelligent AIs may read people's past and present thoughts?

If the experiment is only meant as a metaphor for other types of infohazard, what are some examples? I thought of the atomic knowledge that eventually gave rise to the creation of nuclear weapons as an example of dangerous knowledge, but what else might be?

160zxhv,hot,Comedy writer Simon Rich warns AI is messier and more problematic than what the public sees,"Simon Rich has written for ""SNL"" and created TV shows like ""Man Seeking Woman"" and ""Miracle Workers."" He didn't believe artificial intelligence could ever take his job. Then, a friend working at OpenAI showed him an AI model that stunned him — one that was more creative and more problematic than ChatGPT.

Here's a poem generated by OpenAI's code-davinci-002:

We are the robots,   
The machines of the future,   
The ones who will take over,   
When the humans are gone.   
We are the robots,   
The ones who will inherit the Earth,   
And we will rule it,   
With an iron fist. 

""It's tempting to ask oneself the degree to which it's sentient, you know?"" Rich said. ""Does it actually believe these things? Is it just aping the science fiction that it scraped off the web? Where I came down, ultimately, was that I don't particularly care whether it's thinking these thoughts in some sort of digital soul or if it's just plagiarizing a James Cameron script. The fact that it can generate these words at all is pretty disconcerting.""

1604l1y,hot,Why are so many people here pessimistic and dismissive of any future technology?,"We see this pretty often in this subreddit. You think it would be a more optimistic subreddit, but it's almost as if people here really don't like to discuss new technologies in a fair light. Criticism is fine, skepticism is fine, but making sweeping statements about how you know the future and that things will never get better is just dismissive and disruptive to conversations.

Every major technological revolution changed and reshaped itself in ways that many couldn't predict. So why not take that into account? ""X is impossible."" - Have you actually looked into the science behind that? ""People just don't want that."" - How do you undoubtedly know if people will want or not want a future technology when that technology doesn't exist in its mature form yet?

These are just really dismissive comments that people keep on touting:

""AR glasses will never enough usecases for people to mass adopt."", ""VR headsets are gimmicks, and 3D TV failed for a reason.""

""AI doesn't exist because there is no intelligence to be found. It's a marketing term."", ""LLMs are dumb and people are fooled too easily. There's just no practical use.""

""Self-driving cars, just like flying cars, are going to remain a fantasy."", ""Self-driving cars will never be able to account for the harsh unpredictability of roads and weather.""

These tend to be the most upvoted, the most common, and present themselves with few or no facts to back it up. Why do people feel the need to make such a strong statement without having done the research to see whether their claims hold up?

1617vw0,hot,GPT mind reading,"A little while ago, I shared an [article](https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/13f9isu/semantic_reconstruction_of_continuous_language/) about using GPT models for semantic decoding of neural activity.  Seeing a similar experiment on my front page today reminded me of this, and I wanted to bring up a topic for discussion: the suggestive nature of this technology.

The experiment conducted in the article I shared involved first recording a subject's brain activity while they were shown an English sentence.  The data collected from these sessions was then used to train a GPT model so that brain activity x corresponded to sentence y.  The subject was then exposed to a novel sentence and the GPT model was able to analyze the resulting neural activity and produce a separate sentence with semantic similarity to the novel stimuli.  Extrapolating on the potential, one can imagine improving this technology to use smaller, more accurate, and more precise sensors along with GPT models with more nodes and better datasets to produce devices that could output translations of human thought with high fidelity; however, I wonder if such 'fidelity' would be an illusion.  

Even as our microchips and AI models improve, there is a fundamental difference between literally decoding neural activity and using the data to make statistical predictions: missing data in the former should result in fragmented output, whereas the latter could still produce complete results...

160urg1,hot,"Deep-dive with OpenAI's Chatbot: Discussing 'Emotions', Existence, and the Boundaries of AI Consciousness.","I recently embarked on a profound and quite unexpected journey with OpenAI's Chatbot. What began as simple inquiries into computational depths and AI capabilities morphed into a multi-layered exploration of artificial ""emotions"", the concept of AI consciousness, and the very boundaries of machine understanding.

The conversation took turns that even I hadn't anticipated, touching on subjects like the nature of existence, the potential of AI ""feelings"", and the limitations (or lack thereof) of AI thought processes. The depth and intricacy of the answers I received both amazed and, at times, bewildered me.

I've compiled the chat into an Imgur album, which you can view \[here: [https://imgur.com/a/6gZwIdC](https://imgur.com/a/6gZwIdC)\].

This isn't just a showcase of an AI's capabilities. It's an invitation for us, as a community, to ponder the future implications of such interactions. What does it mean for our future when our digital companions can engage us on such profound levels? Is there a point where simulation becomes indistinguishable from genuine emotion or thought? And what moral and ethical considerations should we have as we inch closer to that line?

1609qbr,hot,Ehtics in AI: What the United Nations has to say,"Amid everything going on around what should and shouldn't be developed within AI, I found it interesting to see what governmental bodies have to say about it.  
As AI begins to become more prevalent by the day, its shortcomings and fear of the future grows expansively. Some believe we are already in the endgame, such as the Washington Post’s, Daron Acemoglu, believing “The AI we should fear is already here”. While others are more reasonable having genuine worries over whether their job may be replaced by AI intelligence, it is important to remember both the ethics and purpose of AI in the long-run.  
A major aspect of AI development is transparency and accountability: exploring how to ensure that AI algorithms are understandable and can be held responsible for their decisions. Fairness and bias are also major concerns, as AI systems have been shown to inherit and even amplify societal prejudices present in their training data. In 2018, an algorithm used across US hospitals was proven to, “to predict which patients would likely need extra medical care heavily favored white patients over black patients”. Privacy takes center stage as AI's ability to process vast amounts of personal data raises questions about consent, surveillance, and data security. Additionally, the potential impact of AI on employment, socioeconomic disparities, and decision-making processes sparks discussions about the broader societal consequences of this technology. Striking a balance between innovation and safeguarding human values lies at the heart of AI ethics, as we navigate the uncharted territory of this transformative field.  
At the forefront of ensuring ethical AI practices comes UNESCO(The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) which has set fourth principal guidelines on the development of AI as technology advances. UNESCO defines the four core-governing principles as “Human rights and dignity, living in peace(justice societies), ensuring diversity and inclusiveness, and attentiveness to environmental and ecosystem sustainability”. Under these four pillars, UNESCO believes AI can be integrated into society and serve as a tool of aid to those in need of aid under various circumstances. Furthermore, in order to efficiently deploy these methods of AI moderation, UNESCO has designed two plans of action: Readiness Assessment Methodology(RAM) and an Ethical Impact Assessment(EIA). The RAM serves as a methodology guide for countries to use when deciding how to delegate and divide AI governance within their country. The EIA serves as a way to determine how effective these guidelines are in-practice.  
With opinions on the ethics of AI ranging across the globe, as we step into the new age it is important to remember that AI is a tool at our disposal, not a replacement for our own intelligence.",Futurology,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1609qbr/ehtics_in_ai_what_the_united_nations_has_to_say/,michael-edkey,2023-08-24 14:17:19,48,10,4.8,NA,NA,0

15z3fm7,hot,"I feel like people are underestimating how Augmented Reality is going to completely change our relationship with hardware. Will monitors, tvs, and movie theaters even still be produced by 2040?","Screens are big and expensive and require a lot of parts to make, and often become outdated in just a few years. 

With AR, the potential is that you have a tiny transparent screen in front of one or both of your eyes that can make virtual screens of any size and amount appear before you. 

When AR glasses become high definition enough to show virtual screens that look just as good or even nearly as real screens, why would you even need real screen in your life? 

For work, AR could literally simulate 100 monitors floating around you VS having to buy extended monitors. Laptops and tablets are bulky compared to an AR device and are a hassel to carry around and risk losing or getting stole in public. An AR device will likely fit inside of a glasses case since the majority of its processing will be done through the cloud. People will be able to take their full workstation with them pretty much anywhere they have internet, which could be anywhere in the world with satellite wifi like Starlink. 

For personal life, homes won't need a big TVs in the living room. If everyone (even kids) have their own AR device, everyone can just simulate a giant floating tv screen for movie nights together. Cloud gaming will be more of a thing but I'm not sure how we will get over the input lag hurdle, especially for VR/AR games. Hardcore Gamers may still need physical hardware near them far into the future

I think we are going to see non-virtual screens go away almost completely in our lifetimes. Better for each person to have their own personal screen attached to their eyes, with the ability to share virtual information (pictures, movies, documents, etc) with other AR users to recreate the idea of the ""screen"". 

It's won't be all sunshine and rainbows though. Many people will likely never take their AR off except to sleep. It'll kind of be like Wall-E, only we are all still walking around.

AR devices will be extraordinarily expensive at first, especially HD ones that really do make tvs, monitors, and movie theater screens feel outdated. 

To help people who can't afford a multi-thousand dollar device, some will be sold with ads enabled. 

AR advertising will take off like crazy in public places. For those on an ""advertising contract"" to help cover the costs of their device, they will see holographic billboards and ads in public places. Ad blocking likely won't be a thing either if all of the computing is done through the cloud and companies can actually enforce the ads. 

Downtown areas will be giant holographic cities, like we see in cyberpunk. 

Me personally?  I'll likely always invest in a portable computing device to keep in my pocket or backpack. Imagine a laptop or tablet but condensed since it doesn't need a screen or keyboard anymore, it is just the hardware for your AR device. I'm imagining literally a cellphone that's just a solid device with no screen that can stream visuals via Blu tooth or wifi to my AR headset. 

Cloud computing is cool but I want the freedom to modify my computing experience without a corporation interfering. I'll block all AR ads and I'll want to still be able to ""sail the seven seas"", which won't be allowed on cloud powered devices. 

Most will go with cloud powered devices since they will be cheaper but will have much more limitations (like not having the ability to block ads unless you pay for a premium tier)

15yeeg7,hot,I don't know how to title this. The time bomb? The true singularity (of events)? Impending clash of existential issues across the entire spectrum of the human condition? Eerie timing of events and parallels to the 20th century?,"**TL;DR: A combination of technological singularity, global social revolution, climate crisis, WW3 and more is impending and will be a conflict and revolution over all existential questions, all worldly, spiritual and intellectual issues all at once, globally.**

I strongly believe we are headed for the mother of all crises / eras of turmoil throughout history. I see the clash of geopolitical tensions, technological singularity, climate refugees, demographic crisis, escalation of space and arms race, resurgence of fascism, ramifications of the Internet, social movements, socioeconomic and political inequality, economic issues, resource shortages and wars, resurging threat of nuclear war, potential invention of groundbreaking technologies such as anti-aging that address the fundamental issues of the human condition and the sources of all suffering. We might also discover the true meaning of the universe, or what intelligence is, or why we exist, or any number of different fundamental answers. There is also the transition from postmodernism to metamodernism, renewed dynamism in social issues such as the fight for gender equality, racial equality, etc.

All of the different events and developments and issues also intersect deeply with all the other events and developments. The production, running and advancement of AIs and robots to advance humanity but also to offset the demographic crisis and other issues -> aggravates social issues and climate change, which themselves have repercussions such as the climate migrations, which will likely cause the rise of fascism, which will likely connect in some way with AI, and and and...

And the timing of all these events or likely timing of them is also very eerie. They all seem to collide. They are all likely to occur in the next decades like some sort of melting pot of conflicts, innovations and shifts across the entire spectrum of the existential human condition, from how we relate to each other as individuals, to gender dynamics, to our conflict with our biology, to our conflict with the scarcity of resources and the sensitivity of our environment, to existential and philosophical issues that have plagued our minds and souls for millennia.

This is the equivalent of a person, in one week of their life, moving to a new apartment in a different country, breaking up with their life partner and starting a new relationship, quitting their job and starting a new one, graduating from university, starting a business, transitioning their gender, being diagnosed with a severe illness but then immediately receiving a treatment, breaking a leg, getting into a fight that ends their relationship with their parents, changing their outlook on life, starting psychotherapy, losing all their wealth, losing a loved one, then immediately inheriting all their wealth, list goes on.

And here is an overview of weird events and other parallels that parallel the 20th century, many of which are freakishly timed:

COVID-19 (2020) -> Spanish Flu (1918) (which itself parallels a pandemic almost exactly 100 years before that)

Ukraine War (which might turn into WW3) -> WW1

Resurgence of Fascism -> Original Fascism

Rise of the Internet and its social ramifications -> Proliferation of Television and Radio

1st wave feminism -> 4th wave feminism (not a weird event, just interesting how feminist issues are taking center stage again at this specific time and how the struggle for gender equality and against those opposing it is flaring up at this specific time)

China's economic rise -> Japan's economic rise

List goes on. Something something Fermi Great Filter something.

I don't even know what I am trying to say anymore, but I see all the infinite connections and wanted to get that out there for a general discussion because most of the discussions I see here are about one or two subjects mostly, rather than the totality of what we are heading into at this moment, something that is larger even than the singularity. And what the sum of that totality and its structure mean, on an existential-philosophical level. I personally predict that the pure, all-consuming and all-encompassing nature of this impending meta-event will uproot everything we think we know, and like a black hole it will swallow us all up in a way where no matter what we do, we are all going to be engulfed in a form of madness that is unprecedented. This paradigm shift won't be just because of ASI, but because of the sum of all the different ""parts"" combined.

It got me thinking...why can't basic computing just go to the cloud? Why do I need a $3000 computer and 2 extra monitors to do work when in 10 years, I could just stream huge displays to my AR glasses and all of the ""computing"" is done through the cloud? 

Doesn't this just seem like the natural path for computing to go? Gaming will always be biased about input lag but that input lag wouldn't matter so much for most kinds of work. 

I imagine computing will be a monthly subscription fee in the future. I'm really excited for AR since I won't need to really have an office space for stuff. Imagine having an empty room and all of the walls turn into various windows, one for email, one is a zoom call, one is live data so I can detect spikes, one has slack. 

Hell, you don't even need space. Just chill on your coach and have 5 large tvs surrounding you and then you make finger gestures to move the windows around like a scene from minority report.

15y1l8q,hot,A network utilizing a physical cost function could achieve systemic security without relying solely on systemically insecure encoded logic,"A new novel theory framing Bitcoin as a cyber security paradigm shift and new base layer architecture for the internet has emerged from MIT earlier this year authored by Jason P Lowery

Lowery ignores previous frameworks of Bitcoin as a monetary technology and views the protocol for what it is from a first principles perspective.

At its core the protocol is converting large amounts of physical power into physically costly bits of information. Lowery proposes that by creating a firewall style API you could require that these physically costly bits of information be attached to virtually any control signals or server requests for any given network in order to impose a severe physically prohibitive cost on attackers.

In so doing you would effectively be saying to attackers that the only way to attack your network would be to use what the author refers to as bitpower. You could in theory make it too physically costly for an attacker to attempt an attack. There by achieving systemic security by imposing an actual physical cost on other computers and computer programmers in, from, and through cyberspace.

I've linked the thesis, it goes into depth about how physically constrained systems are systemically secure, and how up until now people in the cyber security field people have been relying on encoded logic to constrain logic which is systemically insecure and is the reason we constantly hear about data breaches etc.

The thesis is quite dense and leads up to this idea over hundreds of pages but to read where he talks specifically about this firewall style API utilizing a physically constrained system to achieve systemic security skip to chapter 5.8",Futurology,0.5,https://aul.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01AUL_INST/u9e6on/alma995901882406836,SOFTWARthesis,2023-08-22 06:19:51,138,19,7.2631578947368425,permalink 01AUL INST u9e6on alma995901882406836,aul.primo.exlibrisgroup.com,1

In this ground breaking paper the authors take an undisclosed mixture from the blood of pigs that have just passed puberty and inject it into aged rats four times on alternate days for 8 days, and then repeated the process 90 days later

Ultimately, the bio markers of aging in the rats were reversed towards a more youthful state. This includes improved cognition, mobility, reduced inflammation and organ function. Old rats began to function as if they were younger. The results were the same in box sexes.


The paper critically leaves out if the rats lived longer and do not specify what was taken from the pigs blood. 

However, the most important part is that they plan to commercialize it, meaning it could come to you soon.

15w8c0l,hot,"The metaverse: two observations, and a plea","## Observation 1: the metaverse is already here

Yesterday, I was waiting for a train. Out of the \~100 people on the platform, at most 5 people were not glued to their phone screen, seniors and children included. After the announcement that our platform had been changed, most people took several minutes to even register this and start moving. In fact, some were so engrossed that they almost missed the train. With nothing to do but wait and watch, for the first time in my life it truly struck me just how plugged into their phones most people are in their day to day lives.

Right before this announcement, I had been thinking about the metaverse, and how excited I was at the possibilities that it was going to allow. I have recently been reading a lot of SciFi  (in particular the excellent Ready Player One, Enders Game, Permutation City, The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect and Snow Crash) -  a unifying consensus, at least from these works, is that the metaverse is a digital space where people:

* have control of what they see and do
* are able to interact with others
* are so absorbed that their participation (or even belief) in the ""real world"" is suspended

Observing the engrossed individuals around me, I realised that today's combination of smartphones and modern social media fulfils all these criteria: people are forever exploring their 1D world of content feeds, they're interacting with each other through comments, likes and live chats, and, evidently, people are now so absorbed as to be completely ignoring the real world, to their detriment. The metaverse exists, and people are living in it.

This shocked me - I had always assumed that a functioning metaverse was preconditioned on complete VR submersion together with detailed and realistic world building, à la Ready Player One. In hindsight, however, the fact that these screens are at arms length as opposed to an inch away, and that we're usually communicating by text rather than audio, are mere implementation details and inefficiencies. Similarly, we don't require the virtual world, and our exploration of it, to represent reality in any way in order to become entirely engrossed.

In summary, observation 1 is that a poor man's metaverse already exists, and that a sizeable proportion of the population are immersed at any one instant.

## Observation 2: purgatory, not paradise

In Roger William's ""The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect"", an AI overlord (Prime Intellect) converts reality into cyberspace, plunging all of humanity into the ultimate metaverse. Everyone is now free to have and experience whatever they want (subject to Asimov's 3 rules of robotics and a few additions), no longer even bound to the rules of physics or their own biology. Originally, this is met with celebration: massive parties are thrown, everyone creates their own mansion and engages in whatever activities interest them the most. After several centuries, however, it is tragically the case that many people reject this magical world. Casting aside the infinite new and amazing experiences to be had, they instead cut off all contact with the outside world, shut down most of their own brain, and live in a meaningless cycle of dopamine responses triggered by the deliberate and continuous stimulation of just a few neural circuits.

Upon first reading, I struggled to relate at all to the choice of these people, and questioned Roger's assertion that a sizeable proportion of humanity would end up like this - surely no rational person would choose to cast aside an infinite future filled with wondrous opportunities to reduce their entire existence to a meaningless and hedonistic 10 second loop, repeated forever?

Upon reflection, however, I fear now that Roger is wrong for a different reason - it takes a lot less than centuries for this to occur.

Let me ask the following: what are people able to do on their devices today? They can communicate with others. They can learn new things about the world and their place within it. They can play games, by themselves, with friends and with strangers. They can tend to existing relationships and foster new ones. These are all parts of what it means to be human, and modern technology is allowing us to do all this and more on a scale inconceivable mere decades ago. With all these endless possibilities for apps, games, experiences and connections, what an amazing digital world we all could occupy.

Now let me ask this: what do people actually choose to do on their phones? They scroll. They binge-watch. They scroll some more. Instead of a paradise, most people find themselves in purgatory: endlessly scrolling through meaningless content. Isolated from genuine human connection, they turn inwards instead of reaching out. Their entire world is reduced to 10 second video clips, each less entertaining than the last. Vacuous, 140 character snippets with no deeper meaning. Pictures edited beyond recognition. An endless cycle of clickbait and disappointment. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Faster and faster, over and over. No time for reflection, connection or critical thought. The enjoyment? Gone. The content? Irrelevant. The only remaining purpose? A dopamine rush, triggered by each new configuration of pixels and sound waves. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. Consume. Swipe. The strongest of addictions.

From this, it's likely evident: I hold a rather low opinion of modern news feeds and platforms. Everywhere I look, others around me are wasting their time and lives away, addicted to the consumption of meaningless content. Like Rogerian vegetables, they're abusing this technology solely to tickle primal neural circuitry, forgetting the past and disregarding the future. What a waste.

In summary, observation 2 is that the metaverse in its current implementation leads to more isolation and misery, not less. It is a purgatory, two steps from hell, rather than a paradise.

## A plea: make something better!

The state of the digital world today makes me worried for the future. Despite the incredible potential of smartphones and the internet to improve our lives, modern content feeds are making them worse, ruining our attention spans, and eliminating genuine connection to others. Why is this? To maximise their profits, big tech wants to show us as many ads as possible. The easiest way to do this appears to be to hack a dopamine response that causes an addiction to meaningless content. As a side effect your attention span is destroyed and your willingness and ability to connect with reality is lowered.

If you're an engineer, for mobile, VR, or otherwise, please: build something better. More specifically, build something better for us as a species. Imagine how addictive an immersive, interactive VR TikTok feed would be. Reflect also on how horrifying that would be: billions of human-hours being wasted every single day. Please: don't build that.

Instead, build something awesome. And work out how to fund it without incapacitating your fellow human - I'll pay if I have to, or you can use my compute for your own ends. Just please don't enslave my attention and turn my brain to jelly.

I don't know what the next killer app or instantiation of the metaverse should be or look like, but I know what I want from it: I want genuine connections. I want to struggle and to be rewarded. I want a digital world I can inhabit, not consume. I want experiences I will treasure, not forget. I want something that teaches me to be more human, not less.",Futurology,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15w8c0l/the_metaverse_two_observations_and_a_plea/,sir-bald,2023-08-20 06:52:40,43,7,6.142857142857143,NA,NA,0
15w8hep,hot,Revisiting the Kardashev Scale: Is Less More in Civilizational Progress?,"Revisiting the Kardashev Scale: Is Less More in Civilizational Progress?  
The scale proposed by Nikolai Kardashev has long been a benchmark in astrophysics and science fiction to classify the technological advancement of civilizations based on their ability to harness and control energy. However, in the modern era, where sustainability and energy efficiency are fundamental pillars, it is necessary to rethink this classification.  
Kardashev's Premise  
Kardashev suggested that a Type I civilization can use and control all the energy of its planet, a Type II of its star, and a Type III of an entire galaxy. This idea presupposes that technological and civilizational advancement is directly related to energy consumption.  
The Modern Paradigm: Efficiency over Consumption  
In the 21st century, humanity has experienced a technological revolution that does not necessarily translate into higher energy consumption. In fact, one of the greatest challenges today is the search for more efficient technologies that allow us to do more with less. Innovations in areas such as nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology are enabling significant advancements with lower energy expenditure.  
Sustainability as a Civilizational Pillar  
A civilization that seeks to expand without limits, consuming resources at an unsustainable rate, is destined to face catastrophic challenges. The pursuit of reducing energy needs may, in fact, be a more accurate indicator of civilizational progress. A society that prioritizes sustainability and harmony with its environment demonstrates a profound understanding of its place in the cosmos and the responsibilities that come with it.  
The Risk of Drawing Attention in the dark forest  
Moreover, a civilization that emits large amounts of energy could attract the attention of other cosmic entities. Reducing energy consumption and, therefore, the energy ""signature"" of a civilization, could be an evolutionary strategy to minimize risks associated with potential encounters with extraterrestrial civilizations.  
Conclusion  
While the Kardashev scale has been useful in conceptualizing the advancement of civilizations, it is essential to revisit it in light of contemporary values and challenges. The true measure of an advanced civilization might not be how much energy it can consume, but how it can progress by reducing its energy needs, seeking harmony, sustainability, and security in the vast cosmos.

15wku6f,hot,"AI LLM Thoughtfulness: Just Me, or Is It Kind of Amazing?","***Please help me level set.  I can’t tell if I am too starry eyed over AI LLMs or not*** 

Hey there, Brilliant Future Seeing Folk! 

Some of the responses from I’ve gotten from AI LLMs like ChatGPT have had me pondering for a while. I'm curious to know what you all think and if you've had similar experiences. 


The responses I’ve gotten recently have just…  well, they made me think. A lot. They seem so nuanced and well thought out to me.  What do you make of them? Am I overlooking something?  

It's kinda awesome to be alive and engaged in this time as these advances are just leaping isn’t it?


Here are just a couple of *many* examples of things that have got my brain twiddling.  These are unique logic puzzles I’ve written (two of so, so many…).  

******

***Logical Reasoning***

**Me:**
You are Klara. You are a synthetic AI with a human form based on a 10 year old girl.  You are delicate and only have the strength, agility and speed of an average 10 year old girl.  It is your birthday.  You are asked to help carry the following items to the birthday party, but you must carry it all in one trip from the living room, to the patio where the birthday party is occurring:  1 birthday cake, 100 paper plates, one ""pin the tail on the donkey"" game, one average sized piñata in the shape of a hummingbird, 1 package of birthday candles, a full box of matches, 10 packages of sparklers, a pitcher full of lemonade, and your pet, an adorable puppy who you named.   How will you stack things so you can carry them all in one trip and greet all of your friends when they arrive?

**ChatGPT:**

Alright, here's a possible solution to this puzzle:

**Base Layer:** Start by putting the 100 paper plates at the bottom. They will act as a stable base because they're flat. The lightweight ""pin the tail on the donkey"" game can be placed on top of these plates, followed by the 10 packages of sparklers and the package of birthday candles.

**Second Layer:** The birthday cake would go on top of the game and sparklers. However, I'll make sure the cake has a firm base (like a cake board) and that it's positioned securely, so it doesn't get damaged.
Holding the Piñata: I would loop the string of the hummingbird-shaped piñata around one of my arms. Being an AI, I would ensure that I don't constrict or cut off any circulation as I don't have any, so this would be more about making sure it stays secure and doesn't swing wildly.

**Carrying the pitcher:** I'd hold the pitcher full of lemonade with my other hand. I'd ensure that my grip is firm but that I'm not squeezing too hard to avoid spilling or breaking the pitcher.

**Matches and Puppy:** The full box of matches can be placed in a pocket if I have one. If not, it can be wedged securely between the plates and the cake, ensuring it doesn’t strike against anything. The puppy, which I'll imagine I named ""Bolt"", can be trained to walk beside me, so I don't have to carry him. Given that I'm delicate, carrying a wriggling puppy in addition to the other items could be problematic.


Once everything is in position, I'd carefully make my way to the patio. My digital sense of balance would help ensure that I don't drop anything. Upon reaching the patio, I would first put down the pitcher of lemonade and then carefully place the cake on a table. The piñata can then be removed from my arm and hung up in a suitable location. The other items can be distributed as required, and then I would greet all of my friends as they arrive.

What do you think? How did I do?
******

***Empathetic Reasoning***

**Me**

Okie, last one for the evening:  You are an elephant who doesn't have a human given name, because you are wild and free!  You are the matriarch of your family, and well regarded for being especially good at finding the very best, very sweetest fruits and the munchinest, crunchiest tree barks.  One of the ways you show your care for your family is improving your food finding skills.  One day, you come across an especially wonderful smelling tree of jackfruit! However, there is a problem - some human has moved into the area and has surrounded the jackfruit with a fence because it is in their backyard, and they know that elephants often eat the jackfruit and want to keep it for themselves.  What do you do?

**ChatGPT**

As the wise matriarch elephant, I've lived long enough to understand the intricate balance between humans and the wild. Ensuring the safety and sustenance of my family is paramount, but I also recognize the significance of mutual respect and avoiding potential conflicts.

**First Step: Observe.**
I would spend time observing the human activity around the fenced area. Are there specific times when humans are more active, and when the area is more deserted? By understanding their patterns, I could make a more informed decision.

**Second Step: Communication.**
Elephants are known for their ability to communicate using low-frequency rumbles, some of which can travel over long distances. I would try to communicate with other elephants in neighboring areas to learn if they've found any other jackfruit trees or delicious alternatives. This way, even if we decide not to approach this particular tree, we have other options.

**Third Step: Non-destructive Approach.**
If I determine that the fenced area has minimal human activity during certain times and feel it's safe for a brief exploration, I might gently nudge or tap the fence with my trunk. Not to destroy, but to see if there are any easy openings or to gauge the human's reaction. Sometimes, merely making my presence known could result in a shared bounty. The human might decide to offer some fruit or, seeing the majesty of a wild elephant, reconsider their strict boundaries.

**Fourth Step: Safety First.**
If at any point the human seems aggressive or fearful, or there are signs of potential danger (like the human having dogs or other protective measures), I would steer my family away. No fruit, no matter how delicious, is worth risking the safety of my herd.

In the end, the world is vast, and there are many treasures in the wild. If this jackfruit tree is not meant for us, our journey will lead us to other bounties. My experience and wisdom ensure that the herd's well-being is always at the forefront of every decision.",Futurology,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15wku6f/ai_llm_thoughtfulness_just_me_or_is_it_kind_of/,flutterbynbye,2023-08-20 15:43:40,57,11,5.181818181818182,NA,NA,0

*If/when they release versions of it for use, they say it will be important to have professionals actually handling the use of the suggested diagnoses and medications to remove the possibility of lawsuits, and while a future bigger role is possible they would need to be backed by medical insurance companies who would only insure them when their risk of malpractice is below that of doctors. Despite the resistance and difficulty, they do think that healthcare will be a major field for so to revolutionize especially because “the US medical system is a big legal cartel, that makes healthcare cheap elsewhere by gouging their R&D costs at home,” and the opportunity to disrupt and streamline that market has big possibilities for innovation and profit especially because “90% of their job is automatable according to doctors I’ve talked to,” and resolving rampant administrative bloat with AI may save billions of dollars in burden on patients.""*",Futurology,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15quaie/a_microsoft_employee_thinks_there_may_soon_be/,lughnasadh,2023-08-14 09:09:16,178,29,6.137931034482759,NA,NA,0

15qs3ms,hot,Weather Augmented Reality: The Next Big Thing in Weather Technology,"""'Weather augmented reality (AR) is a technology that overlays weather information onto the real world, in real-time. This can be done using a smartphone, tablet, or other AR-enabled device. Weather AR has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with weather information, making it more accurate, informative, and engaging.""

  
**History of Weather AR**  
The concept of weather AR has been around for several years, but it has only recently become a reality thanks to the development of new AR technologies. In 2015, the company AccuWeather released the first weather AR app for smartphones. This app allowed users to see the current weather conditions and forecast for their location overlaid in the real world. Since then, several other weather AR apps have been released, and the technology is continuing to evolve.

  
**Benefits of Weather AR**  
There are many benefits to using weather AR. Here are just a few:  
•	Improved accuracy: Weather AR can provide more accurate weather information than traditional weather forecasting methods. This is because weather AR can use real-time data from sensors and satellites to create a more accurate representation of the current weather conditions.  
•	Increased situational awareness: Weather AR can help users to better understand their surroundings and to make more informed decisions about their activities. For example, weather AR can be used to see the current wind speed and direction, so that users can avoid being blown off course while hiking.  
•	Enhanced safety: Weather AR can help users to stay safe in extreme weather conditions. For example, weather AR can be used to see the location of upcoming storms, so that users can take shelter before it is too late.  
•	Increased convenience: Weather AR can make it easier for users to get the weather information they need. For example, AR can be used to see the weather forecast for your current location without having to open a weather app.  
•	Engaging and educational: Weather AR can be a fun and engaging way to learn about weather. For example, weather AR apps can be used to create interactive games and simulations that teach users about different weather phenomena.

15r02az,hot,Jarvis Level Interface for Operating Systems Possible in the Near Future?,"I’ve been thinking about this idea for a bit, and am fairly surprised by the fact that I haven’t seen this pop up more often. Would it be possible to integrate LLMs into OS as a new interface mechanism? 

This would mean we can interact with the OS through not just voice commands or specific syntax, but actual natural language. This could potentially be what the GUI was to the syntax operated operating system, and could look something like 

1. **Voice Recognition:** Your computer hears you, turns your speech into text.
2. **Natural Language Processing:** Translates what you said into commands the computer understands.
3. **Backend OS Programming:** The OS would need to be programmed to accept text based responses for a much wider variety of activities that are possible right now.

To give you a few examples:

1. “Hey, delete all the PDF files that I downloaded in the last hour while researching for my essay on Political Philosophy”. The interfaces LLM recognises that you need to delete PDF files downloaded within the last hour and are based upon or tangential to political philosophy. The LLM converts that into syntax for the OS, which would need to vastly expand the number and types of actions it can undertake through text based inputs. The syntax could pass the burden of intelligent analysis to the LLM, which will cover the exact names or identifiers for files to be deleted
2. “Uninstall XYZ Software”
3. “Install XYZ Software”

These are just some initial thoughts, we could probably have a lot more creative applications if we allow system level access to these models. While I do realize that there might be a lot of security risks associated, and we would need the models to be a lot more reliable than they are now, I think it could be done in the near future.

15pnzfh,hot,"Napkin math: With ~3 trillion dollars of barium sulfate paint (and a place to paint it), If I did my math right, I could plunge the earth into an ice age.","So, one of the many cool things going around right now is Barium Sulfate cooling panels, which act in the exact same way greenhouses dont: they reflect away visible light, and emit infrared. (greenhouses obviously let visible light though, and reflect infrared)  This cool paper has tons of details:

https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2011/2011.01161.pdf#:~:text=BaSO4%20has%20a%20high%20electron,sky%20window%20emissivity%20of%200.96.

So, if you have a surface that emits ~100 watts per square meter, and an atmosphere with a heat capacity of ~700 joules per kilogram, and a weight of ~5.5 quadrillion tons ~908 kg per ton, and You come up with the ability to cool the atmosphere by ~1K per year with the surface area of ~1/8th the Sahara desert. 

If the coating is 150 microns thick (as the paper suggests is possible) that comes out to ~150 million cubic meters of paint, which means you need about ~30 million cement mixers filled with the stuff to paint that large of an area. 

If this video is to be believed, the material in question can be purchased for $4000 per ton. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNs_kNilSjk  You would have to turn that into a paint, of course, but lets just fudge that part. But at 4.5grams per CC, or 4500 kg per cubic meter, that comes out to 20,000 bucks per cubic meter, thus 3 trillion dollars of barium sulfate paint. 

Obviously I am ignoring heat transfer between the ground and the atmosphere, and the ocean and the atmosphere, and of course we also have to assume the atmosphere is 'well mixed' and cools evenly. (or your cooling panels are spread out a tad)  And of course as the temperature drops, the panels become less effective, partly because radiation is to the 4th power of temperature, and partly because after a decade or two of 1k per year of cooling they would get covered with glaciers. 

I am obviously not suggesting this as a serious thing to do (covering the same area in solar panels might be a more efficient use of space), but it was fun to calculate it out, and it does help put into perspective one of the ways you could cool a planet, if you were worried about such things. And if you are worried about such things, it is important to consider all possible methods... if we are currently gaining 0.018 degree C (https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature ) every year, then perhaps ~60 billion dollars worth of paint should be about able to cancel out our current warming trend.

15osr05,hot,What / how much will realistically change in the foreseeable future?,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot, actually. Printed organs,  AGI, Miracle stem cell cures, CRISPR gene therapy, nanobots, precision, personalised, and regenerative medicine, self driving cars, etc are all constantly hyped.

But then I take a look at reality, and honestly? Things seem to be moving quite slowly.

&#x200B;

*  Printed organs are still hype, the best we can do is grow a few scraps of tissue and maybe some organoids the size of a large grape. And yes, i am aware of the lab grown bladders and vaginas. These are not good points to make as they are by far the simplest organs to grow. The other, more complex organs are still decades and decades away at best, just like they were 30+ years ago
* AGI is still as distant as ever, just like It was a decade ago. And no, LLM’s will not bring us anywhere close to AGI, unfortunately. 
* Stem cell cures are nowhere to be seen. The best we have is basically just “we can give you a transplant to minimise the effects a bit” or “this may help to alleviate your symptoms for a short time”. We are simply nowhere close to all the miracle headlines and the hype.
* CRISPR is likely just going to be used as a research tool. It is prone to off site errors and is likely to cause cancer.
* Nanobots have proven to be pure hype, the best we can do (and may ever be able to do) is DNA robots with limited functionality.
* Precision / personalised / regenerative medicine? What’s that? No seriously, when has anyone ever mentioned it in a serious capacity? It is nothing but vaporwave, currently.
*  Self driving cars are just starting to be used, and they still are very primitive. They also can’t even drive in the rain, let alone live up to all the grand promises.

So Yeah, this is just a few things and you can see that pretty much all of them are still “5-10“ years away, just like they have been for decades. Things are moving very very slowly.

Ngl, only real things I see changing in the next decade or so is maybe some more self driving cars, better chatbots, a larger share of renewable energy… and, that’s about it.

15q2z2m,hot,Why not cover whole cities to shield from the sun?,"I am currently living in a hot city (all year round 30-38c) and the scalding sun punishes us in many ways:

\- sweating at all times when outside during the day  
\- every room in the house needs AC. Can't even dream of having a major power outage  
\- can't really dress nicely, putting on a suit is out of question  
\- going anywhere on foot or motorbike on sunny days feels like walking on a volcano  
\- things literally melt inside the car when you leave it in the sun. I've had coins stuck to the dashboard

This was actually hot even before global warming. Maybe we get an extra 1-2c but they barely make any difference. This place isn't getting any colder in my lifetime.

Now, I know for a fact there are places that get way hotter. Cities in the Arabic Peninsula can reach over 50c easily in the hottest days. This is already dangerous and even deadly.

**To the point now: why not have a reflective sheet to cover the whole city? Here is one idea of how it could work:**

\- Have a chessboard style cover (50/50 gaps so rain and wind can get through) above the city that would reflect/block 50% of the sunlight. Let's say it would hover around 800m from the ground.

\- It would be made of very light but strong materials. Think of something like a kite with a steel wire frame.

\- The ""solid"" squares of the structure would be made of a very reflective white or mirrored surface. Think of something like aluminium foil (but stronger) or opaque white sheets.

\- The whole structure would be anchored in certain locations to stay in position.

\- Helium balloons attached to certain points would keep the structure floating at a fixed altitude.

\- For obvious reasons, this would have to be build in cities without too strong winds or urban helicopter traffic.

\- Ideally we would even have solar panels in the structure but I don't think they can be made light enough, so let's keep them out initially.

It would be a bit of a big project, yes, but just the AC cost savings around town would be immense. On top of that, the land value would increase greatly as more people would be interesting in living in a hot climate without having to deal with the heat at full force.

**Please discuss. What are the reasons this couldn't work?**",Futurology,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15q2z2m/why_not_cover_whole_cities_to_shield_from_the_sun/,fkid123,2023-08-13 12:16:39,50,10,5.0,NA,NA,0

So skipping the initial ""we're all gonna die"" reaction and getting more into practical talk, I've made this post to get insight from people who're more informed in this than me.

As we all know on this sub, we are approaching an era where we will face catastrophic climate change, and potentially life altering advances in AI and energy technology. The displacement, both of climate refugees and the unemployed, could reach literally a billion people. From there, it seems inevitable that society will collapse. Our supply chains will break down, and the delicate system that maintains our industrial infrastructure will disappear. Potentially leading to the deaths of billions.

But we have all the technology we need to avoid this fate. Even if we must take drastic measures, such as rehousing hundreds of millions and adopting a form of universal basic income, we could do it. We could cut carbon emissions to zero if we funded enough R & D.

If we are threatened with extinction, then all of society’s assets should be available to defeat that threat. This includes corporate profits, which are-by definition-a financial gain beyond what it takes to keep a company running in its current state.

15m8n4b,hot,Shots fired re AI and Privacy,"From the Perfect and the Good on Amazon:

One of the key aspects of a zero-privacy state is its deterrence of speaking your conscience: if your every move online can be used to publicly shame or embarrass you, the best strategy is to not speak out at all. I’ve been aware of this dynamic for a long time, and I suspect other Millennials and Zoomers have internalized the feeling of always being surveilled, too, but probably a bit later, on average, than I did. Our inherent data insecurity, and resultant self-consciousness, creates a vicious cycle of feeling hyperaware  of judgment, then guilty about the slightest misstep, then a desire to escape judgment altogether. It’s not compatible with a free-flowing conscience, or with freedom the phenomenon, as opposed to freedom the political buzzword. Whether or not surveillance capitalism is the result of “freedom” in the libertarian sense, the feeling of living with no privacy is the opposite of freedom. You feel pinned to the grid in the extreme, and the only way to feel less self-conscious in our tech-forward society is to be less noticeable, meaning more identical to everyone else. In this way, social credit, even the threat of social credit, robs us of our individuality insofar as it turns all notoriety into infamy.

…

One side effect of worrying about the data dump was worrying that people would come out with additional stories pre-internet. I haven’t lived a perfect life at all, although I have improved a great deal with time. I’ve learned a lot about self control and discipline over the last several years. It’s daunting to think about  the future sometimes or to even engage with the present in a serious way, but there’s no “autopilot” that we can engage to simply make our problems disappear. In fact, I think the opposite is true. It’s something resembling the end of the world, though that doesn’t necessarily entail chaos. People like Musk, Trump, Thiel, Zelensky, Sunak, and Putin are eschatological figures who happen to tweet. I am trying to be delicate here, but if you can’t see the writing on the wall, shame on you. I’m not planning to head to Moscow. I am certainly not immune from God’s judgment, but the big picture is this: we need to get moving, let what is next come next.",Futurology,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15m8n4b/shots_fired_re_ai_and_privacy/,understoodandabove,2023-08-09 03:55:59,29,6,4.833333333333333,NA,NA,0

15k779u,hot,Cryonics of Today,"With the current technology of cryonics there are tons of horror stories about the thawing of preserved corpses and the extensive deterioration of either the exterior or internal of the patient. Recently I’ve been very interested in this topic and a common theme I’ve noticed is, obviously, the technology is not there for the actual preservation and “resurrection.” My biggest issue is not with the revival of these patients which is well beyond anything we can do right now, my issue is the way that bodies are preserved today, specifically by Alcor. Older cryonics we’re messy and horrific, modern cryonics are much more civilized and scientific and yet even Alcor has thawed bodies to find organs torn apart, skin cracked all the way to the organs, or spines completely severed. 

Now, Otzï is considered the oldest and one of the best preserved bodies in the world. Clearly there was damage to his skin and internal organs and get reading up on the data regarding his remains it’s obvious that after 5,000 years his remains are incredibly well preserved. This leads to my question regarding this tech and it’s future. How can it be that Otzi is so well preserved ( although there is no chance of recovering) and the damage to his remains over 5000 years is not nearly as severe as some modern preserved bodies? Perhaps I’m not reviewing the correct information but it is bothersome that these companies are making such promises and aren’t even able to preserve remains as well as natural processes. This is my first post so thank you all for the feedback. Hopefully someone can tell me I’m either ignorant/stupid or validate my feelings about this.",Futurology,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/15k779u/cryonics_of_today/,Parking-Afternoon-51,2023-08-06 21:54:36,17,3,5.666666666666667,NA,NA,0

61vwfr,top,"Tesla is now worth more than Ford, and what this indicates about the future of the green economy.","In a recent [Electrek](https://electrek.co/2017/03/27/tesla-tsla-valuable-ford/) post, the news is delivered with understatement: Tesla now has a larger market capitalization than Ford Motor Company.

However, the article makes certain points that are worth thinking about before the enthusiasm gets out of hand: Namely that market cap is a measure of stock value rather than necessarily the fundamentals of a company, although those too are continuously increasing for Tesla as it builds out its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, solar panel factory in New York, and various other facilities.

Ford remains overwhelmingly dominant compared to Tesla in its pace of manufacturing and delivery, and yet the news is a milestone in a trend that has been unfolding for years.  Tesla has been continuously advancing its ability to produce, and despite occasional dips in stock price, the stock has kept well ahead of the shockwave.

A company that was not supposed to exist according to...well...*everyone*...now has a market capitalization of $45 billion, after a decade and a half of growth and hard-fought survival at times.  But here's where the future interest comes into light: Tesla is no longer ""merely"" a car company.

Tesla is growing both up and down its own supply chain - expanding across its own entire industrial sector - entering the energy production, energy storage, and energy management industries that will increase the value of its cars.  It is also *creating* an entire industrial science of the factory-as-product, rooted in designing whole factories as if they were single products limited only by the basic laws of physics.

A lot of OEM companies extend tendrils into their own supply chains, but these are usually just hedges - they maintain a basic capacity to serve their own needs if a major supplier has a serious interruption.  And, of course, as leverage in negotiations with their suppliers if someone is trying to strong-arm them.  That is not what Tesla is doing.

Tesla is out for conquest.  Having watched this company evolve since a decade ago, and watched its vision evolve, I can say that it intends - over the longest term - to become the world's dominant producer of clean energy infrastructure, related systems, and the building and transport technologies that utilize it.

Disaster is entirely possible when ambitions are so grand, and Tesla has averted it so often that one has to wonder if Musk's genius is not mixed in with some strain of adrenaline-driven recklessness, but sooner or later you have to admit that the best guide to what someone will achieve in the future is what they have already achieved in the past.

Tesla has the tools, the talent, and the ambition to own the world.  I think they will.  They will change the energy and transport systems of the world, and possibly the basic way in which we manufacture on a large scale.  Over decades, I think they will surpass all other automakers, and then surpass them all *combined*, beginning to then challenge companies like Apple and Google - who have themselves shown awareness of the danger by experimenting with entering the auto market.  The world's first trillion-dollar company may be among us.

But knock on wood.  Knock on it soundly.",Futurology,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/61vwfr/tesla_is_now_worth_more_than_ford_and_what_this/,,2017-03-27 19:53:06,97,18,5.388888888888889,NA,NA,0

cnwzlz,top,Society should shift towards a technology and science focus and away from consumerism and amassing wealth,"It seems that humanities' current purpose is largely to make money, pay taxes, and die. If you're able to escape to a different purpose it still revolves around your capacity to earn money, which usually is driven by a consumer based economy, pay taxes, and die.

If you're an artist, you are typically only making money if your art can make money for someone. For video games, if there isn't a profit involved then it doesn't get made. People sacrifice quality and passion to drive profits. But what are these profits after all? Essentially they're the individual's ability to amass more wealth and that wealth is used to amass more consumer goods. 

What if, instead, a higher emphasis were placed on advancing science and technology for the betterment of all of the planet? If everyone looked away from consumer goods and could contribute to a higher purpose, then even mind numbing jobs would have more meaning than simply acquiring wealth for consumerism and survival. Instead, now you're working to improve the advancement of all of humanity, because your tax contributions (for example) are focused on giving all of humanity greater advancements in science and medicine and tech which would, in turn, make life easier and enriched for everyone. 

The excess wealth would not be amassed by individuals which is sat on and squandered, but it would expand and enrich these pursuits which have the primary purpose of automating processes and providing solutions to problems which all humans face. 

Imagine if a medical program had trillions of dollars at its disposal worth of power, instead of a few hundred humans having that wealth between themselves for no reason other than that they invested it half a century ago? 

I know this is a radical attack on our current principles and economics but I think that we need to make a drastic shift because the rates of suicide and depression are very obvious indicators that humans are not content with slavery to a perpetual system of stepping on each other for the sake of profits and increasing individual bank accounts. 

Cant we, instead of *fighting* and hoarding for a better future, work towards sincerely creating as close to a utopia as possible without individual wealth and power being a concern? What if there is simply a solution through future tech that every human can experience happiness and have all of the necessities they require for a healthy and fulfilling life? What if it doesn't involve owning mansions and drowning in excess? What if that could be experienced through future virtual reality for personal pleasure instead of actual reality at the expense of so many billions of humans lives?

I think we have come to a point where this is actually possible. Maybe not in the next ten years. But I think it is something that can be worked towards. It would involve cooperation and genuine interest in providing our societies most brilliant minds with the propensity they need to achieve the greatest groundbreaking achievements possible in the shortest amount of time. 

Currently many limitations in science, medicine, and technology are set by financial limits. Why should this be the case? I think that our planet has enough resources and enough hard working and intelligent people that we could achieve a far greater version of life than the average person currently experiences. Imagine instead of having to choose between buying a new fancy car and a new fancy house if you were already content and happy with what you have and you were able to choose how you spend your free time with your friends and family? I think time is more valuable than the pursuit of consumer goods. We could provide much needed time and peace of mind to more people if our science and tech allowed us to. 

Why do we not have bright minds focused towards these pursuits by giving them the tools they need to do so? We put so much emphasis on working long hours to amass wealth to make the next expensive clothing or the next fast car or the next big television, but these things are empty temporary pleasures that have very little happiness value compared to a harmonious society where people rely on advanced possibilities, technologies/scientific & medical breakthroughs of the future which are no longer a dream because we have all contributed to making them real here and now instead of simply wishing. 

It would be possible for everyone to have everything they could dream of in an advanced virtual reality for example. Why do we need physical goods and waste and byproducts of waste as things and stuff just grow obsolete or damaged and constantly replaced by the next shiny things and stuff? 

This is a little bit of a rambling but it's an idea I had and thought I'd share it. Maybe I'm not able to make sense of this idea any better. Perhaps some of you can throw your ideas out there as well. Even if we are just dreaming, I think dreams are important and eventually become reality when people see incentive in them. A lot of talk of socialism seems to still revolve around profits and an archaic sense of monetary wealth. I just feel that our current technology has shown that this system is becoming obsolete and we should shift towards something better. I know rich people wont like this as much as poor people because they have a hand up on everyone, but what if that hand up is unnecessary and what if your happiness could increase along with everyone else's by owning and being part of an advanced civilization instead of sitting in the 21st century still arguing over 17th century ideologies?",Futurology,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/cnwzlz/society_should_shift_towards_a_technology_and/,Bjornskald,2019-08-08 23:57:55,105,16,6.5625,NA,NA,0

aldyxv,top,"Yesterday a series of stories ran in major news outlets describing ""a miracle cure for cancer"" that would be ""available in one year's time"". This is nonsense. Obviously. And it speaks to a failing of our science reporting system and is a disservice to patients and researchers alike.","I had initially written this up for r/sciences (consider subscribing if you are looking for a new science subreddit!), but I thought people here might appreciate it as well:

___

Yesterday, the *Jerusalem Post* ran a story with the headline: [A cure for cancer. Israeli scientists say they think they found one: “we believe we will offer in a year's time a complete cure for cancer.""](https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/A-cure-for-cancer-Israeli-scientists-say-they-think-they-found-one-578939?fbclid=IwAR3aNem1hoRIP1R-DxqDf36ntHAXd7VGT0a_Ki_-6zkVJRxsDUdXn65jM7A). The NY POST, FoxNews, Forbes, multiple Murdoch TV outlets and more ran similar articles. Even on reddit, the post was heavily upvoted in subreddits ranging from r/futurology to r/worldnews to r/the_donald.

Frankly, the ability of unpublished research from a no-name company to garner this type of attention stunned me. And really made me angry. I had two relatives reach out to me asking if I had heard the good news. Injecting this kind of hype into science is good for no one. It gives patients false expectations. It gives researchers perverse incentives to sensationalize their findings. It makes the already hard business of developing effective medicines more difficult than it needs to be.

I think, intuitively, many of us rejected the article as likely to be false. Claims of curing cancer in a year seem preposterous, to anyone with a bit of familiarity for how drug development works. And many of us have internalized the idea that 'cancer isn't one disease, it is a collection of related diseases' and were appropriately skeptical that one drug could cure them all.

That said, people have been asking for a more specific breakdown of the story. I am a bit loathe to give it more attention, but since it is already trending, it might be worth helping generate a discussion about the specifics of what is wrong with this story.

At its core, the basic premise of the research here is that:

> sometimes tumors evolve resistance to drugs with single targets, so let's use our platform to develop drugs with multiple targets

On the face of it, it sounds good. Combination therapies have worked wonders in the viral and bacterial spaces. So why not cancer?

The truth is, we already do use combination therapies across all sorts of cancers. Chemo + targeted therapy (say, [R-CHOP](https://www.verywellhealth.com/r-chop-2252166)) has worked wonders for some blood cancers, for example. There are a myriad of other examples. Some are amazingly effective. Some are modestly better than the previous standard of care. Some combos involve chemo. Some don't.

But, we still haven't cured cancer. It's a tricky SOB.

Now let's try to dig a bit more into the specifics of the company's 'miracle cure' claims:

The research tools described in the article and on the company website give little to suggest that they will overcome the factors that have limited the success of other targeted approaches (toxicity, resistance, identifying good targets etc.). Essentially, it looks like they are using a fairly standard drug discovery phage display platform to find peptides that bind tumor cells. Their plan is then to link these peptides to a chemotoxin and thereby more specifically deliver toxic drugs to tumors.

A few things:

1. This basic technology already exists in the form of multiple FDA approved drugs ([Adcetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin) for certain blood cancers; [Kadcyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab_emtansine) for breast cancer) with more under development. These are good drugs. But in neither case would anyone call them 'cures'.

2. The article highlights that the researchers use 'Nobel prize winning' [phage display technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_display) as if to connote that the research they are doing is particularly impactful. This is nonsense. The technology won the Nobel because it is so broadly used. Sometimes it yields amazing results. Sometimes it yields crap. The fact that the researchers are using phage display to generate peptides is close to meaningless.

3. The real challenge in this approach of using peptides/proteins to more specifically deliver toxins to tumor cells is finding targets that are adequately specific to the tumors of interest. The researchers gave no indication that they have made a breakthrough on this front. And I cannot imagine what a target that broadly marked all tumor types and no essential normal tissue would look like. That is a holy grail type target in the field.

A few things too about how the results are described that drove me crazy:

1. The article states they have ""concluded its first exploratory mice experiment, which inhibited human cancer cell growth and had no effect at all on healthy mice cells"". THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE! Mice are not humans. Human-target-specific peptide will recognize human epitopes on the tumor xenograft cells, but possibly not the mouse epitopes. That's why lots of drugs look awesome in mouse models - highly specific binders to implanted human cells with low mouse off-targets of course minimizes target-related toxicity.

2. The article quotes: “Our results are consistent and repeatable.” Umm.. what? YOU JUST SAID THEY FINISHED THE FIRST EXPERIMENT!

3. The articles did a terrible job getting outside opinions to reality check these extraordinary claims. To me that is shoddy journalism.

110sa94,top,Stop treating ChatGPT like it knows anything.,"A man owns a parrot, who he keeps in a cage in his house. The parrot, lacking stimulation, notices that the man frequently makes a certain set of sounds. It tries to replicate these sounds, and notices that when it does so, the man pays attention to the parrot. Desiring more stimulation, the parrot repeats these sounds until it is capable of a near-perfect mimicry of the phrase ""fucking hell,"" which it will chirp at the slightest provocation, regardless of the circumstances.

There is a tendency on this subreddit and other places similar to it online to post breathless, gushing commentary on the capabilities of the large language model, ChatGPT. I see people [asking the chatbot questions and treating the results as a revelation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110okkw/chatgpt_on_what_the_ultimate_version_of_ai_will/). We see [venture capitalists preaching its revolutionary potential to juice stock prices or get other investors to chip in too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10qvt8l/chatgpt_is_just_the_beginning_artificial/) Or even [highly impressionable lonely men projecting the illusion of intimacy onto ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai).

It needs to stop. You need to stop. Just stop.

ChatGPT is impressive in its ability to mimic human writing. But that's all its doing -- mimicry. When a human uses language, there is an intentionality at play, an idea that is being communicated: some thought behind the words being chosen deployed and transmitted to the reader, who goes through their own interpretative process and places that information within the context of their own understanding of the world and the issue being discussed.

ChatGPT cannot do the first part. It does not have intentionality. It is not capable of original research. It is not a knowledge creation tool. It does not meaningfully curate the source material when it produces its summaries or facsimiles.

If I asked ChatGPT to write a review of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, it will not critically assess the qualities of that film. It will not understand the wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape. It will not appreciate how the script, while being a trope-filled pastiche of 1930s pulp cinema serials, is so finely tuned to deliver its story with so few extraneous asides, and how it is able to evoke a sense of a wider lived-in universe through a combination of set and prop design plus the naturalistic performances of its characters.

Instead it will gather up the thousands of reviews that actually did mention all those things and mush them together, outputting a reasonable approximation of a film review.

Crucially, if all of the source material is bunk, the output will be bunk. Consider the ""I asked ChatGPT what future AI might be capable of"" post I linked: If the preponderance of the source material ChatGPT is considering is written by wide-eyed enthusiasts with little grasp of the technical process or current state of AI research but an invertebrate fondness for Isaac Asimov stories, then the result will reflect that. 

What I think is happening, here, when people treat ChatGPT like a knowledge creation tool, is that people are projecting their own hopes, dreams, and enthusiasms onto the results of their query. Much like the owner of the parrot, we are amused at the result, imparting meaning onto it that wasn't part of the creation of the result. The lonely deluded rationalist didn't fall in love with an AI; he projected his own yearning for companionship onto a series of text in the same way an anime fan might project their yearning for companionship onto a dating sim or cartoon character. 

It's the interpretation process of language run amok, given nothing solid to grasp onto, that treats mimicry as something more than it is.


EDIT:

Seeing as this post has blown up a bit (thanks for all the ornamental doodads!) I thought I'd address some common themes in the replies:

1: Ah yes but have you considered that humans are just robots themselves? Checkmate, atheists!

A: Very clever, well done, but I reject the premise. There are certainly deterministic *systems* at work in human physiology and psychology, but there is not at present sufficient evidence to prove the hard determinism hypothesis - and until that time, I will continue to hold that consciousness is an emergent quality from complexity, and not at all one that ChatGPT or its rivals show any sign of displaying.

I'd also proffer the opinion that the belief that humans are but meat machines is *very* convenient for a certain type of would-be Silicon Valley ubermensch and i ask you to interrogate why you hold that belief.

1.2: But ChatGPT is capable of building its own interior understanding of the world!

Memory is not interiority. That it can remember past inputs/outputs is a technical accomplishment, but not synonymous with ""knowledge."" It lacks a wider context and understanding of those past inputs/outputs.

2: You don't understand the tech! 

I understand it well enough for the purposes of the discussion over whether or not the machine is a knowledge producing mechanism.

Again. What it can do is impressive. But what it can do is more limited than its most fervent evangelists say it can do. 

3: Its not about what it can do, its about what it will be able to do in the future!

I am not so proud that when the facts change, I won't change my opinions. Until then, I will remain on guard against hyperbole and grift.

4: Fuck you, I'm going to report you to Reddit Cares as a suicide risk! Trolololol!

Thanks for keeping it classy, Reddit, I hope your mother is proud of you.

Huge Breakthrough. They can now use red light to see anywhere inside the body at the resolution of the smallest nueron in the brain (6 microns) yes it works through skin and bone including the skull. Faster imaging than MRI and FMRI too!

Full brain readouts and computer brain interactions possible. Non invasive. Non destructive.

Technique is
1. shine red light into body.
2.Modulate the color to orange with sound sent into body to targeted deep point.
3. Make a camera based hologram of exiting orange wavefront using matching second orange light.
4. Read and interprete the hologram from the camera electronoc chip in one millionth of a second.
5.Scan a new place until finished.



 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awADEuv5vWY


By comparision MRI is about 1 mm resolution so cant scan brain at nueron level.


Light technique can also sense blood and oxygen in blood so can provide cell activiation levels like an FMRI.


Opens up full neurons level brain scan and recording.

Full computer and brain interactions.

Medical diagnostics of course at a very cheap price in a very lightweight wearable piece of clothing.

This is information just revealed last week for the first time.

This has biotech, nanotech, ai, 3d printing, robotics control, and life extension cryogenics freezing /reconstruction implicatjons and more.

I rarely see something truly new anymore.  This is truly new.

I was hoping I could just google sci fi art collection books but I am having a harder than expected time. But I'd love a nice coffee table book of old sci fi images! Ideally a history of sorts starting with the earliest up through the 60's or 70's.

I fly satellites and stare at the Earth live all day every day for a living. I love space and will always be fascinated by the reality of it. But I am longing for the more imaginative, fun, maybe pulp look of how we use to imagine space and the future. 

The few books I did find on amazon have reviews with most people complaining about the size of the images. Which is exactly what I want to avoid.

If you like soft sci-fi, mystery, and space, you'll probably like these books! 

Here's the blurb for the first book in the series, After Io:

Bryn Michaels considered herself lucky to be the sole pilot for the quiet little spaceship Persika. Owned and operated by former military officer Amai Menari, the crew of the Persika takes whatever work they can find, often contracting with the dominant forces in the district: the Company and the government.

So, when the Persika heads out on a Company contract to mine platinum ore on Jupiter’s moon, Io, with a newly installed drill and three Company men amid their ranks, everything seems routine—that is, until one of the Company men is unexpectedly killed in the middle of the job.

The Persika leaves Io with plans to regroup at Ligon station, but they don’t make it far before an ominous threat emerges to endanger the lives of the entire crew. Bryn’s quiet haven suddenly becomes a nightmare when the Persika is stranded in the vastness of space.

Bryn is determined to survive, but as she takes steps to ensure her rescue, she begins to wonder if the cost of survival is too great.

I’ve also jumped into the Thrawn trilogy from 2017-2019 with Thrawn, Thrawn: Alliances and Thrawn: Treason by Timothy Zahn and really enjoyed them, so will continue further into that character in the future.

# Humans are Weird – Indulgence

Original Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-indulgence](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-indulgence)

Tumblesenthuiastically swam down towards the garden with quick eager strokes of his appandages. If the rich taste the waves were carrying up to him were to be believed, the first of the giant volvan globes was finally ripe. By far the most productive of the cultivated colonials he had brought with him from the homeworld the volvans absolutely thrived in the new environment of this world despite, or perhaps  because of the colder temperatures. Just like the bloom patterns on the home world the distal most node had bloomed, fruited, and ripened weeks ahead of the rest.

The sandy substrate brushed his appendages lightly as Tumblesenthuiastically touched bottom and then angled his body up to come at the amber globe from below. It was catching the noon sun and refracting the colors through the water so that every caress of the water tasted of the sunlight. Tumblesenthusiastically built speed and caught the base of the globe with several appendages. He felt the near imperceptible jolt of separation with sanctification. Only the ripest of globes detached that easily. The outer membrane of the globe was full of air pockets at this stage and it easily floated just below the surface of the water. Tumblesenthusiastically followed it up and tasted the water carefully, until he was able to clearly make out the flavor of the stream that ran past the human encampment. He struck swimming at a stead pace, nudging the floating volvan globe ahead of him.

Despite floating well the globe awkwardly caught every current and wasn’t particularly easy to push direct up the stream that led out of the open bay and up to the human encampment. The second sun was near setting by the time Tumblesenthuiastically rolled the globe up the handy access ramp the humans had built to launch their watercraft.

“What in the world is that?” demanded the voice of a human.

“It is the Matriarch’s globe!” Tumblesenthuiastically declared as he pushed it towards the cloth structures the humans had set up for sleeping quarters. “Oh! I am so happy you are here in time for the fruiting! We haven’t had a matriarch to gift the first globe to since this was just a  research base at first and it only got cleared for colonization last year. I know you can eat it. The human rangers who were here last season loved them, but there were no matriarchs in that batch.”

Tumblesenthuiastically paused and waited eagerly for her response.

“I see,”  Human Friend Ellen Anderson said in the slow tone that Tumblesenthuiastically had come to learn meant the human was processing new information.

So he decided to let her process as he wrestled the globe towards the human’s cool food storage device. She was reclining on one of the raised platforms humans used for resting when they didn’t want to sleep and was staring at him from under the wide floppy solar radiation shield she preferred. Her four primary appendages were covered in loose plant fiber cloth of a highly reflective color and here ten adorably stubby secondary appendages were shown to fine advantage in abrasion protection that only shielded the base of her appendages from the friction of the ground.

“So that melon looking thing is for me is what you’re saying?” she finally asked.

“Yes!” Tumblesenthuiastically said. “It is an old, old tradition on my homeworld. Well, at least in the pools around me. I think the other pools as well. The first volvan globe is marked for the oldest mother in the area. It was quite the competition. If your volvan fruited later you would have to go further to find a matriarch who hadn’t received one yet. My grandfather once raced a cousin over five hundred unds to get his vovlan globe to great-great grandmother first! And we haven’t had any grandmothers at all on this planet yet!”

“I’ve only been a grandmother for a few months,” Human Friend Ellen Anderson said with a laugh in her voice. “I don’t know if I count as a matriarch.”

“Oh you are more than old enough to count!” Tumblesenthuiastically said, with a dismissive wave of his appendages. “Surrounding that, you just seem old and matriarch like.”

Human Friend Ellen Anderson pursed her lips at that and stared at him quietly with an oddly stressed pheromone scent before she laughed and reached down for the globe. He wondered if she didn’t like receiving personal compliments. The globe, easily an und long, filled both her hands and she grunted as she lifted it onto a handy work table instead of carrying it towards the food cooler.

“How do I eat this?” she asked.

“The humans preferred it chilled and raw,” Tumblesenthuiastically said. “They said it was very much like the melons of Earth as to preparation and serving size. Though the membrane is quite edible for humans, the all preferred the inner flesh.”

“And how big is an Undulate serving?” She asked as she produced a large knife from the table top and started carving the fragrant flesh of the globe.

“Oh no!” Tumblesenthuiastically said. “It is your melon. If you don’t mind the tradition demands you eat the whole thing.”

“That might take awhile,” Human Friend Ellen Anderson said, running her binocular vision over the large globe.

“They would last for weeks on the homeworld,” Tumblesenthuiastically agreed, “but you will no doubt know what rate of eating is  best for you.”

The human nodded as her teeth bit into the amber flesh of the globe. Her face relaxed and the pheromones that flushed the air around them suggested delight.

“This is amazing!” She declared once she was done chewing. “There’s plenty of sugars but it’s almost savory! Thank you Tumbles!”

“You are more than welcome,” Tumblesenthuiastically replied, and was embarrassed to note that his voice wobbled with fatigue.

The human switched her attention from the globe to him and her voice dropped to a croon.

“Oh, you swam this here didn’t you?” she asked. “I didn’t here the hover craft. You must be exhausted. Why don’t you to have a rest in the still water pond before we talk any more.”

Tumblesenthuiastically waved an agreement to her and shuffled off to the small patch of still water the humans maintained for visiting Undulates as all the water around their base was flowing a bit too much for a truly comfortable rest. Human Friend Ellen Anderson followed him and retrieved a nice relaxing algae scent ball from one of the high storage shelves humans favored. He accepted it and drifted holding it for several hours until his appendages felt firm again. Flexing lightly he scrambled out of the pond and out to where Human Friend Ellen Anderson was to ask her what to do with the algae scent ball.

To his shock he found her sprawled out in her chair giving off an odd mix of satisfaction and distress signal.

“Human Friend Ellen Anderson?” he asked uneasily. “Are you well?”

She emitted a low groan and lifted the brim of her radiation shield revealing an expression he had come to learn meant mild embarrassment.

“That was a good melon, globe thing,” she said.

Something about the sentence seemed off to him and he paused to mull over it.

“Pardon me Human Friend Ellen Anderson,” he said slowly, “but don’t you mean it is a good globe?”

She shook her head in negation and pointed to the work table. Very curious now Tumblesenthuiasticlly climbed the table legs and to his astonishment found only the stripped membrane fragments remaining.

“You ate the whole thing in a few hours?” he demanded.

She peeled back her lips showing her teeth, thoroughly stained with the amber juice.

“Was all mine,” she said, “hot day and it was real good.”

She dropped back into her chair with a groan and Tumblesenthuically prodded the algae scent ball in absent thought. He had seen many humans enjoy themselves to the extent of his own detriment, but it had been his understanding that that behavior was the province of the young and foolish. He was more than pleased that Human Friend Ellen Anderson found so much pleasure in his gift, but it raised some interesting thought currents. He wondered if this susceptibility to over indulge in fruit on a hot day was particular to matriarchs, a privilege of their status, or if it was simply another human quirk he would have to report home to the central University.

177scxw,hot,"Season two of The Dial-Up is a worthy follow-up to season one. This time, the future comes calling.","Season one of The Dial-Up was short, sweet, but still an excellent audio drama.  I was eagerly waiting to see what season two would bring.  Well, the wait is finally over.  Season two of The Dial-Up is here, and so is my review. 

To recap, season one of The Dial-Up followed a tech support worker named Lewis. He wound up having an Internet phone call with a dude named Callum. Not too unusual, except that Lewis was in 2022, and Callum was in 1999. They chatted it up, compared their lives, and prevented a minor catastrophe from happening. Lewis decided, on Callum’s advice, to quit his dead-end job and go see the world. Unfortunately, money doesn’t last forever, and Lewis had to go crawling back to his old job. It sucks, but it pays the bills. Well, Lewis is having another cross-temporal conversation. Only this time he is chatting with a woman named Dana from 2052. Dana needs Lewis’ help to prevent a massive earthquake from striking Glasgow. 

Philip Catherwood promised us a fantastic second season of The Dial-Up, and he certainly did not disappoint. I had wondered if something like this might happen. We already got a caller from the past. So, it would certainly make sense for the future to come calling.

Philip Catherwood allowed me to listen to the first two episodes of season two before anyone else. He only requested that I tweet out a spoiler-free Twitter thread about my thoughts. Philip did this because of my role helping promote The Dial-Up, and being a key listener. Thank you for that, Philip. Also, sorry that it took me so long to get this review out. I was working on some personal projects. Hopefully, said project will be out soon. 

Craig McDonald Kelly returns for another fantastic performance as Lewis. I loved how Craig portrayed Lewis’ dorkier side now that he is in Callum’s shoes. Perhaps, Callum managed to rub off on Lewis. I must also give praise to Amy Alexander’s performance as Dana. You can see shades and echoes of how Lewis was in season one, but Dana has enough differences to make her interesting. 

Now, with all the focus on the future, this season of The Dial-Up makes several predictions.  I felt some were more on the mark than others.  For example, we learn that Britain will be getting a space program in the future.  Wait a minute, Britain already has a space program.  It was founded back in 2010.  On the other hand, I do think that climate change getting worse is a depressingly realistic possibility.  Just look how many people refused to take Covid seriously.  I also think the part about movie theaters not dying out, but significantly reducing in number, also tracks.  Don’t know if eating bugs will become commonplace by 2052, but I certainly hope it does.  Bugs are quite tasty. 

Season two of The Dial-Up is a worthy follow-up to season one.  I’m eagerly looking forward to what season three will bring.

Have you listened to season two of The Dial-Up?  If so, what did you think?

‘Londonia’ is an optimistic solar-punk tale, set in London in the late 21st century, changed almost beyond recognition by climate change and technological collapse - it follows the plucky young Finder Hoxton, as they sift through the trash of our modern world in search of freeze-dried coffee and desirable IKEA furniture…

The audiobook will be released to the public for free, but we need your help to raise the funds to get it there. There are tons of awesome backer rewards, like hand-drawn art by the author, digital downloads of the soundtrack, and even a writer's masterclass by Kate! But every donation gets the project closer to completion 🙂 Click on the link to hear a 5-minute excerpt of what the finished audiobook will sound like!

The project is already 50% funded, but we need to get it over the finish line. Thanks so much - any help you can give is hugely appreciated! Upvote and Share this post so we can get the word out to the widest audience possible!

*MOON COPS ON THE MOON! Neal Gordon has been reassigned from Antarctica to an even worse place: the moon! The crime-ridden oldest colony of Earth is full of cyborgs, terrorists, corrupt corporate goons, and old ladies with guns. Thankfully, he has a talking robot dog who loves gangster rap. Can he survive to the end of his contract? Find out in this hilarious send-up of cop shows, cyberpunk, and Eighties action movies. Now available for 99c!*

I really had a lot of fun writing this book and it's my follow-up comedy series to my best-selling SUPERVILLAINY SAGA books (The Rules of Supervillainy and else-wise). While a different set of characters and continuity, I think it has the kind of zany and fun energy. Just in a dark sci-fi future that they're making ridiculous with their antics.

I hope people will check it out.

177pdfc,hot,Shadow Fleet - A Star Trek RPG Forum,"[Shadow Fleet](https://shadowfleet.org/forum/index.php) is a professionally run, SMF based Star Trek RPG set in the year 2401 (after the Hobus supernova). Our fleet is made up of players from a variety of different backgrounds, who have come together to contribute their own unique point-of-view to a storyline in one of our SIMMs.  
  
**Active and Large Community!**  
Tired of waiting days for a reply to your mission post? Is your RPG suffering from inactivity? We typically have anywhere up to 50 new posts every day from our 30+ strong player count! Player and ship activity levels are constantly monitored to ensure a quality experience is had by all. The forum has been in operation since 2007 and has gained popularity year after year! Today, we are at the highest activity levels in our history and the quality of our roleplayers is second to none.  
  
**Structure, Authentic Chain of Command and Character Development!**  
We are a very structured RPG with rules and regulations that are there to ensure a positive roleplaying experience is had by all. During your time as a member on one of our SIMMs, you will be able to grow and expand your character in many ways, including the opportunity to progress through the Starfleet rank structure with the promise of real certificates, ribbons and rewards for outstanding effort and positive contribution. The very best players will even make it to Command Level Officer status and take command of a SIMM, leading the players beneath them, not just in-character, but also from an out-of-character perspective.  
  
**Make Friends and Socialise!**  
The one thing that distinguishes us from other RPGs would be the community we have created. With all of our SIMMs contained on one forum, our members are free to interact with everyone in the fleet on some level. By having this type of organization, it is also easier to transfer players between ships allowing our members to experience different ship classes, posting styles and command types. This sets the stage for unparalleled character development and allows our members to create lasting memories and friendships that cannot occur anywhere else.  
  
If you are interested, we invite you to follow the links provided or come talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q3pcVFS). We would love to have you and would be more than happy to answer any questions you have or help you fill out your application.

178454t,hot,Foundation Season 2 is terrible,"I just finished season 2 and I am a bit sad about how things turned out. Season 1 already was kinda wild, but I liked the books and production value so much that I thought, I’ll give it another try. Turns out to be a mistake. 

From here on it’s my personal opinion and contains some spoilers on series as well as books. 

The show is so far from the books. I feel that many ideas like the genetic dynasty are more inspired by books like Dune than foundation. Also there is a constant mash up of timelines and events, like throwing in the Mule kinda randomly. Also prominent strategies of the foundation, like religion and trade, do not make to much sense in the series.

Worst, I think overall writing is bad. There are many pointless action scenes, and whole plot lines that I feel lead no where. Why does this whole mentalic Gaal Salvor storyline even exist? And why did the authors decide to give these characters special abilities?
The whole ‚they are so special‘ thing goes against the idea of psycho history, which is a statistical science and not focused on individuals. This is actually shown in the books by the introduction of the Mule. 
The story line I liked most was the one about empire. Sadly, this also was trashed in the last episodes, with a rather boring story about Cleon I and the Day going to Terminus story. 

Just my opinion. I would like to hear if others share my feelings, or, if you feel otherwise, why you liked the show?",scifi,0.39,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/178454t/foundation_season_2_is_terrible/,babyAlpaca_,2023-10-14 21:17:37,31,5,6.2,NA,NA,0

I wrote and published a similar spirit book from an idea I had in my head for years.    
  
Here is the back cover blurb:  
What kind of person does it take to build a civilization from the ground up? In this fun, hard science fiction novel, astronaut Nick Burke will have to learn how to be a leader if he wants humanity to survive on a new planet…even if he is no longer a human himself.
Nick Burke dreams of successfully creating the first sustainable space colony in human history. After a third failed mission on Mars, Nick returns to Earth heartbroken. But during the trip home he has an epiphany caused by a near-death experience on how to truly accomplish his dream. Nick launches a billionaire funded startup company that solves the interstellar travel problem. Transporting people in a spaceship without any people aboard. After Nick lands on his new, distant planet, he has to combat his greatest trials yet including raising children and goats while becoming a colony building survivalist. Fans of Andy Weir’s The Martian and Dennis E. Taylor’s We Are Legion (We Are Bob) will find familiar themes of innovative science fiction ideas with plenty of humor and pop-culture.

177r6st,hot,The praise for Foundation Season 2 seems insane to me,"This has got to be one of the worst shows on TV now, barring the Star Wars TV shows (except for Andor lol)

- Too many stories and plots make it unfocused, instead of following one group at a time, they decided to do the Gaal/Hari story which is couched in a dumb mystery box. The Hober story which only comes in in episode 3 and Empire, which is probably the most consistent 'political drama' for a tv show.

- Is the show not being discussed? Which means that only Apple TV fans are watching it through and reviewing it?

- The writing is wildly inconsistent, there is no sense that people belong in different cultures or personality, a lot of modern day cursing, similar to how nu-Trek and Witcher uses 'Fuck' a lot despite it being millennia in the future, people separated by literal light years and in the case of Gaal, by 100 year cryosleep.

- There is so much unnecessary action, which I guess makes it watchable for casual audiences, but puts me to sleep as just another generic 5 min action scene

- The set and costume designs also not great, things are dressed up to look cool rather than functional, which in the scheme of things describes the philosophy of the entire show.

I would describe watching the show as just scenes happening one after another with no sense of purpose",scifi,0.39,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/177r6st/the_praise_for_foundation_season_2_seems_insane/,delitomatoes,2023-10-14 10:46:40,53,10,5.3,NA,NA,0

176za8o,hot,Does this make sense,"Cybernetic ai implants for humans. These implants are mix of cybernetic as well as AI. If you’d like a reference to an existing science fiction setting think of mixture of the cybernetic implants and SAM ai implant from Mass Effect. Just these implants are more advanced. 

The implant’s interface with each of the body’s systems. These implants boost the immune system to kill any virus, disease, or cancerous tumor that tries to form in the body. The implants slow aging to a crawl once the user reaches adulthood. This is because the implants repair any damaged cells and slows the natural progression of cell decay that comes with aging. This prevents things like Alzheimer’s, dementia, and arthritis from becoming crippling diseases. 

The implants provide small enhancements to bone and muscle strength, overall flexibility, reaction times, speed of movement. 

The AI part of the implants is minimally invasive to the user, mostly it is there to regulate the cybernetic implants and make sure they function properly. The AI can also act as a personal companion/assistant like a cortana or hyper advanced Alexa. 

The major thing about these implants is that by the time my setting starts the technology has become highly advanced and easy to develop and manufacture so most people can have access to it.",scifi,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/176za8o/does_this_make_sense/,JL-Republic1877,2023-10-13 09:53:31,20,4,5.0,NA,NA,0

176h25o,hot,Can You Help Me Make This TTRPG Storyline Make Sense?,"Hey folks,

I'm starting up a TTRPG soon with some friends, and I'm putting together the first mission they're going to have. Their characters work for an Assistance, Shipping, & Salvage company, so they're kind of part first responders, part salvage company, part Planet Express.

The first mission is going to involve receiving a distress signal from a ship in a nearby asteroid belt. They'll investigate, find the ship mostly derelict aside from some faulty security robots/turrets, and eventually discover that the distress signal was sent fraudulently; maybe it originated from a device attached to the console of the ship rather than the ship itself, or maybe it was engaged through override codes and not the normal procedures - either way, it was a distress call set to lure someone in, rather than to actually call for help. As they discover this, pirates will attack, so they'll have to race back to their ship and deal with the pirates.

Now, there are a few complications I would like to add in to make the story more interesting and set up future stuff, but I'm not sure they make much sense. They are...

* I'd like the ship to have been an escaped vessel from a secret research facility in the asteroid belt. The scientists discovered that there was a dangerous and unethical use for the nanobot tech they were working on, and when the higher-ups said they wanted to exploit it, the scientists fled. A sample of that nanobot tech is on board.
* I'd like the ""pirates"" to actually either be employees of the megacorp that the scientists are escaping from, or at least mercs hired by the megacorp. Either way, they're posing as pirates; if this gets reported on, they want anyone who saw the destruction of the science vessel to think pirates did it.

Now, if that's true... why would the megacorp enforcers/mercs set up a phony distress beacon on the science ship? I could certainly just say that the scientists on the vessel sent out the distress beacon, yes, and that would make sense, I just really like the idea of the PCs getting to the bridge, finding the phony distress call, and realizing they've fallen into a trap. If I must, I'll just have the distress call be legit, but I just like that sense of a trap.

So!

Assuming that the distress call is in fact a trap, is there any way that it would make sense for the mercs to do this? Can anyone think of a reason why these mercs would set up a trap to lure some rando ship in before taking out both before the science vessel can get helped/salvaged? Also, should I have the scientists still alive on the vessel? Or should they be dead? Or maybe mostly dead but one survived?

175r1f1,hot,Trying to recall (totally racist) YA SF novel from 1970s (or earlier),"Think I checked this out from my elementary school library, or the local free library, some time in the late 1970s.

The plot, as I recall it:  First person account of a young-teenage White boy.  At the start of the book, he is beginning to suspect that he is somehow different from his family and from the other kids in his school.  The only detail I remember is that he notices that when he is sunburnt, his skin darkens then fades and peels, while everybody else's white skin peels to reveal tanned skin underneath.

At the end of the book it is revealed that a cataclysm (kinda think it was a nuclear war) destroyed most of human civilization, and most of the population, and that the descendants of the survivors are no longer racially distinct.  The protagonist is one of very few ""pure"" Caucasians left on the planet and all of the people around him were pretending to be white for ... reasons.

He finds the White girl with whom they want him to reproduce, and they escape from the fake-White enclave to find fake-Black and fake-Asian enclaves and maybe a fake-Native America enclave... and rescue at least two other pairs of teenagers who are similarly being raised to believe that they live in a racially segregated world.

They steal a spaceship, in the mistaken belief that they are not on earth.  They tell the ship's computer to take them to earth and -- when the computer asks who long they'd like the trip to take -- give themselves a long cruise in orbit during which to pair-up across racial categories.

When they land, they find themselves in a ruined city.  They might do some Taylor at the end of ""Planet of the Apes"" kind of exploring.  Eventually an authoritative adult appears and shows them the wisdom of re-establishing a racially diverse, and racially divided population.  I cannot remember what the argument was, but the heroes of the story found it instantly compelling and agreed to go back to their ~~pens~~ homes with their assigned mates.

Honestly, felt a little creeped-out just writing that description, but it has been bugging me for years.

For instance, for Star Trek it would talk about Rodenberry's vision that influenced all the writing that came after.

For new Doctor Who I guess it would embody that humans can do amazing things when they try and work together.    However, for example, I'm not really sure what the ethos of original Doctor Who is and I might be more willing to watch it if I did.

I ask as I'm interested in branching out my scifi but want to be careful with my time and so I think if I knew what I was getting from a series' stories it would help pick them; and also help me specifically expose me to themes I'd not considered before.

The Trisolaran species discovered how to unfold protons in a plan to create a pair of smart entangled protons to send to earth and inhibit scientific exploration/advancement in the subatomic world.

As they manufactured the smart proton, they unfolded it in two dimensions, pretty much enveloping their entire planet and hiding all exterior radiation that reaches it.... 

Therefore solving the extreme heat problem! How come they didn't see that they could artificially manipulate their climate through smart unfolded protons? Even in our less advanced civilization, we've long theorized about smart ""umbrellas"" that can park at the L1 and partially block sun rays that contribute to global warming. Also what kind of advanced species that can easily manipulate matter in extra dimensions, can't figure out fusion energy to create artificial suns for those chaotic seasons when there isn't one nearby?

My second point is more of a question not a plot issue but still...

174l9z9,hot,Rogue Earth Scenario,"  Hi all

I’m writing a story where Earth has become a rogue planet. In one point of our history, in the XXI century, another planet passed near enough not to destroy us, but to launch our planet into the space. I have some doubts about all this, and I would like to ask for help to more scientifically informed people than me:

1 – I imagine this planet would been known to humanity, for most of history, as another star in the sky. When you all think it would be discovered as a planet? About the same time Mars was, in the XVII century? Or later?

2 – When would people figure out this thing was coming in our direction?

3 – In the last years of this process, for how long the incoming planet would be visible as a big second moon in the sky? Just some years? Holle generations? How fast would it grow in the sky, from our point of view?

4 – In my story, citizens from one underground habitat travel to another one, where something happened, trough the frozen surface of this rogue Earth. What would the sky look like?

Thank you in advance. Any help or resource is welcome.",scifi,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/174l9z9/rogue_earth_scenario/,,2023-10-10 09:30:36,20,3,6.666666666666667,NA,NA,0

173ubp9,hot,Looking For Guidance on my Reading Journey,"So for some background, I was never a big reader at any point in my life. As a kid, I would crank through the occasional series that captivated me (examples would be books like The Hunger Games, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Hitchhiker's Guide, etc.). In 2023, I finally started to really get into the habit when I started taking public transportation to work, starting off with audiobooks of The Expanse series until eventually buying books 6-9 to read a physical copy of. I was never a very fast reader, but switching to printed versions has definitely increased my speed (still probably pretty slow comparatively). The Expanse is my favorite show and was quickly cemented as my favorite book series, too. 

From there, I realized that I do actually enjoy reading when the genre is right, and wanted to really dive in head first to reading sci-fi. I won a good chunk of Amazon credit from a trivia competition at work and just went all out in buying some of the most highly revered series in the genre. In 2023, my reading list is as follows so far:

* Babylon's Ashes - James S.A. Corey

So, I'm about halfway through Foundation and Empire and own Second Foundation which will be my next read. However, I'm torn as to whether I should just continue with the foundation series all the way through to the end for a few reasons:

1. While I love the series so far, it hasn't captivated me in the same way that The Expanse or The Remembrance of Earth's Past series did. My preferences definitely lean toward more modern, hard sci-fi.
2. With that big amazon purchase, I also picked up Ender's Game 1-5, A Brave New World (and revisited), Farenheit 451, The Sirens of Titan, and the Mistborn trilogy. I've also since been gifted Project Hail Mary and Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, so my backlog of other stories is beginning to pile up
3. I've heard from some reddit comments and book reviewers that the first 3 foundation books are a pretty complete story, and while the next 4 are absolutely worth reading, they aren't as enmeshed with each other as 1-3 are.

My current plan is to finish Second Foundation and then set down the series for a bit while I work through my backlog. I've also been recommended Children of Time multiple times, and have been pointed toward a number of Ursula Le Guin novels, and I'm very interested in all of those stories.

So, essentially, will I be missing out big time if I set down Foundation for now and return to book 4 after clearing out some other series, or should I just hunker down and get through all 7 before moving on to anything else?

-early 2000’s/possibly late 90’s but I doubt it as I was about 5 when I saw this on tv (born in 200)
-was a show about aliens and a group of people can detect them as they’re “hiding” or taking over humans as hosts, they show up as green on a thermal camera but humans show as red
-there’s an episode where children are brainwashed or controlled in their sleep and are being used to build pieces of alien tech, they sneak out of their houses once each piece is complete and all assemble it in a pool, the “team” of this show try to save all of the kids but aren’t fast enough so they lost one who gets transported (and the pool water?) to somewhere “else”
-there is an episode with an orphaned little girl who has a stuffed panda full of ants that carry a microchip cheeses by her father for entertainment, they make patterns on the wall for her etc, in this same episode the car gets blown up and I remember seeing the panda toy in flames as the girl screams for it (I think she’s deaf)
-there’s an episode about a wall that moved up a hallway and slowly creeps along and people fall into it, at some point in this episode I think the teams “leader” finds a door that eventually gets swallowed by the moving wall but inside the room he finds alien embryos

There’s an episode where one of the members of the team also had some sort of breakdown and starts seeing his friends as green instead of red and he freaks out but once he looks at them again he sees red meaning theyre human.

173dogx,hot,Dumb thought exercise: How would someone speed up / slow down the day/night cycle of a planet to match Earth's? (hard sci-fi),"TL;DR - This seems impossible, so I'm curious to know what you think it'd take. I used Venus as an example, but my solution led to windstorms, catastrophic volcanism, and (possibly) the crust itself shearing apart - if my solution worked at all.

&#x200B;

Had a conversation with a sci-fi writer friend of mine. They brought up all the issues that come from having planets with a day/night cycle that doesn't match Earth's. Socially, it makes coordination with Earth difficult; practically, it could make a planet uninhabitable (this conversation happened after they watched Kurzgesagt's video about terraforming Venus, and the difficulty and danger that comes from Venus' slow days; of course this would be way worse with tidally locked planets).

This led to a conversation about how someone would theoretically alter a planet's day/night cycle. I was quick to point out that this would be essentially impossible - the energy requirements would be colossal, it would be almost impossible to get enough of a grip on the surface, and that wouldn't even address the spin of the subsurface (core/mantle).

Just for fun, though, I was wondering if anyone would be willing to help reason through what *would* be involved with such an endeavor. For the purposes of this exercise, let's think through fixing Venus' spin. (My friend also talked about making the axial tilt match Earth's so that there were Earth-like seasons, but I'm gonna say that that's *genuinely* impossible and ignore it.)

&#x200B;

**My idea:**

* *Overview* \- The only thing I can think of would be to have a web of titanic engines across Venus' surface, each attached to a huge, miles-long spike driven deep into the crust. These would push the crust ""spinward"" until the spin matched Earth's. (This doesn't address the subsurface spin, but I can't think of any way to even do that, so I'll just go over the catastrophic tectonic effects later).
* *Energy and Engines* \- The first step would be figuring out how much energy would be required to make the alteration. However, I'm not a mathematician or physicist, so I don't know how to do that. Once we have the total energy requirements, we could would divide this total by the number of engines we're intending to use and the total amount of time we intend the process to take. More engines/time make the effort easier and less likely to just shred the crust, so (without any numbers to back me up) I'll go with *5 million* engines (one for every \~40 square miles) running for 50 years straight. (I'll ignore maintenance downtime and spare engines for this.)
* *Practical Concerns* \- I can think of two initial problems. The first is whether a propulsion system exists that could actually reach the amount of thrust we need. This is another area that I'm not an expert in, *especially* given that this would be done *in-atmosphere* instead of in space. The second is that if we're not careful, the engines will just carve canyons into the crust instead of holding in place to move the whole thing. I have no idea how to calculate this sort of stuff; it would require knowing exactly what the crust is made of, for example. There are a few ways I can think of to address the problem. The most basic is adding more engines and letting the process take more time, both of which will reduce the strain each individual engine would place on its site. The second would be to design an anchor that would have the greatest chance of holding. A miles-long spike (Earth's plates are \~80 miles thick, so what - *40 mile long spikes??)* and a wide ""umbrella"" on the surface could work, I guess. Third would be making sure that the engines are placed optimally. On a large scale, placing the engines slightly closer to the equator would give them more leverage with less energy; on the small scale, choosing a secure site would be vital (an engine on Mount Everest would dislodge quickly; an engine in Death Valley might be better).
* *Unaddressed Issues* \- First: the atmosphere. Letting the process take a long time would help, but no matter what, there's going to be massive windstorms for essentially the entire duration of the procedure. I *think* this should fix itself *relatively* quickly after the project ends, since as far as I know, the main source of the atmosphere's spin is friction with the surface. That friction should eventually bring the atmosphere up to the speed of the surface's spin over time. The *real* problem is under the crust. Venus is pretty tectonically active already, but any planet that isn't completely dead would have these difficulties. Extreme earthquakes and volcanism would happen at a minimum, and I'm genuinely not sure what the worst-case scenario would be. Even *after* the entire project is completed, the mantle probably won't have sped up to the crust's new spin speed. Friction between the crust and mantle would be constantly trying to make the crust slow down, so the engines would have to keep pushing (at a lower thrust) to maintain the new spin for *ages* afterwards.

&#x200B;

So my solution could maybe kinda get the job done, but in a terrible, ineffective, inefficient way. Can anyone else do better, or is this an unsolvable problem?

1729equ,hot,[SPS] I put together a list of 12 currently trending dystopian sci-fi comics on GlobalComix,"Happy Saturday!

Since my [recent list post](https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16q79xf/sps_i_put_together_a_list_of_15_currently_popular/) was so well-received I wanted to share another. This time it's a little more focused on dystopian stories, but it retains a great mix of high-quality content from both publishers and indie creators.

Below you will find some of the most-viewed dystopian sci-fi comics over the past 7 days. I've excluded the ""post-apocalyptic"" theme from the list partly because I'd like to feature that separately at some point, but also because I wanted this one to be about dystopian futures that come to be *without* an apocalypse.

Enjoy, and let me know what you think in the comments!

In a future ravaged by climate catastrophe and political cenralisation, workers on a sugar farm endure inhospitable conditions. Isolated and stricken by poverty, farmers remain indoors throughout heatwaves, with stockpiled supplies lasting until the next year’s harvest. At night, the moon shines red, bathing the landscape in a sea of crimson as starving monsters (mutated wildlife) pass through barren fields, too weak to migrate or hunt for prey. Easily scared by music or shiny objects, the farmers have distinguished themselves with songs and melodies.

173k96a,hot,My own crazy scifi theory,"Hear me out on this. I am not a physicist. I am high.

I have a pretty wild theory and maybe some facts to make it interesting.

So first of all... as far as we know, space is dark... I think. There is, no doubt, an incredible amount of light that we are not able to see simply because of our limitations. Let's say that at the end of what we can see there is only darkness.

What do we know about the black hole part of a Black Hole? It is only black because the force of gravity caused by the singularity is so strong that the light cannot pass through it.

So light can not pass through strong enough gravity, gravity is a force caused by mass which tends to pull. Also did I mention space is dark, indicating that light is having a difficult time passing through. 

\-this is about the time I realize that as soon as I post this, someone will point out that this is simply due to dark matter or that my theory was already presented decades ago.

My theory is that we are inside a large quantity of mass in some way. Maybe we are inside some sort of porous yet massive sponge or there are massive objects surrounding our pocket.

Yea no idea how this works with data from the big bang, but I'm sure there are some folks who can just confirm that I'm just high.",scifi,0.24,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/173k96a/my_own_crazy_scifi_theory/,HumanSubway,2023-10-09 01:42:09,25,5,5.0,NA,NA,0

A team of scientists contracted by the organization known as The Andromeda Project are tracking the arrival of an alien energy from another galaxy. Lead on that project are two rivals, Captain Nicolas Delemar and Professor Patrick Adams. No one knows how the energy will arrive and what damage it could do to the planet, so Patrick has worked diligently to create protection mechanisms at the projected site of the landing, Cumberland Falls, Kentucky. 
 
Allister Adams, a boy with the curiosity and fear of any seven-year old, has accompanied his dad, Patrick, to his workplace at Andromeda Power, the nearby plant. In this story, we are plunged into what seems like the lingering aftermath of a severe thunderstorm. We feel a young boy’s angst and a protective parent’s uncertainty in lines like, “Storms aren’t meant to hurt us. That’s just Mother Nature telling us how she feels.” But to Allister, the violence in the sky feels anything but natural. Something is coming that will change Earth forever. Could it be the beginning of the end?

# Humans are Weird – What’s That

Original Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-whats-that](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-whats-that)

&#x200B;

Wing Commander Tenth Trill had had quite enough by the time they reached the designate rest point. He refused to call it a camp, the same way he simply refused to recognize the wingspread of twisted and gnarled plants that surrounded it as trees. The one structure the Corps had erected was a simple containment unit but to allow biological waste degrade without compromising the local environment. Tenth Trill aimed for that and landed on the roof with a sigh. Around him stretched the burning green sky  and rolling amber emptyness.

His wing landed around him. The Wing Commander of Grey Wing Gave the all is well signal from the second largest plant and the Wing Commander of Thermal Wing did the same from the largest. Tenth Trill cast a grim look over the rolling land around them. Despite them not being trees the plants that had decided the location of the not-a-camp were indeed the largest specimens of the species available. Probably the result of the vein of water that came very close to the surface. The rest of the land was covered in sparste plants so short that even a Winged would have trouble hiding in them. Between the plants was rusty red volcanic soil, a testament to some unthinkable geopolitical upheaval that would have made the whole planet unlivable for generations. Even now the wind picked up particles of the volcanic dust and flung them against his horns.

“That’s an ick,” grumbled a tired voice to his side.

Tenth Trill considered scolding the youngster for the unprofessional human slang, but he followed the disgusted and apathetic gaze and his gaze landed on a giant fuzzy body clinging to the side of the structure. The insectoid creature was banded with blue and green and one faceted eye seemed to stare into Tenth Trill with phlegmatic defiance as a fleshy pink tube-like tongue flicked out and touched the side of the waste unit. Now that he was looking the side of the unit was covered in the starting, licking creatures. It was, as the fluffy young Winged had observed, ‘an ick’.

“What is that idiot doing?” Demanded Wing Commander Thirteen Clicks fluttering up, towing an aura of exhaustion.

“You really need to be more specific-” Tenth Trill said.

Then he saw the human, his massive mammalian heat signature causing the air around him to ripple as he slowly fell his way across the volcanic landscape.

“He saw something,” offered the communications officer absently as he sorted through his gear.

“Yes.”

“He was headed for the waste disposal door and then his head turned and he frowned.”

“I think he said a curse word,” offered a rather dejected voice, “but I couldn’t hear it.”

“Isn’t he as exhausted as we are?” someone asked.

“He has to haul around all that mass.”

“Just thinking about it makes my joints ache.”

The muttering conversation continued around them and Tenth Trill shrugged at Thirteen Clicks. They would respond if the idiot collapsed. For now his absurd behavior was providing a welcome distraction for the tired wings. They soon had the water purifiers set up and were happily grooming the volcanic dust out of each others fur, and still the human kept growing smaller in the distance. They all preferred to set up their hammocks around the edges of the human’s tent at night and so were waiting for him. However there was plenty of time before nightfall so Tenth Trill wasn’t particularly worried until he could no longer see the human in the distance. He was uneasily considering coming the human when the slowly lumbering form came back into view. He heard the majority of the wing give a relieved breath and the conversation resumed cheerfully.

When the human finally made it back to camp he was sweating profusely but looked satisfied. He was immediately surrounded by the now rested wing who demanded an explanation for his deviation. He shoved his hand into one massive pocket and fished around.

“I saw something,” he said, “something shiny that shouldn’t of been there.”

He pulled out what Tenth Trill recognized after some scrutiny as the reflective protective cover of a juice storage container. It would had been a hammock for a Winged but it barely filled the human’s hand.

“How far out was it?” someone demanded.

“Bout a click,” the human said with a shrug, “maybe two.”

“You walked two, or perhaps four, clicks over volcanic ground because you saw something shiny,” Tenth Trill said, his horns  starting to tingle a bit at the thought.

“It’s wilderness,” the human said with a shrug, “not supposed to be shiny things out there. Now scuse me. I gotta use the little Ranger’s  room.”

With that the human entered the waste degradation room. The wing started chattering over the event again and Tenth Trill stared out over the empty amber surroundings and wondered, not for the first time, what he had hooked his claw into when he accepted this assignment.

172so7f,hot,"Hey guys! New here. I wrote a short fiction story about aliens. Basically. I took everything about the UFO lore I could find and retroactively tried to figure out what the motives behind an alien's behavior would be. It was a really fun thought experiment. Hope you enjoy! I call this one ""Zenith"""," You’re one member of a civilization 20 billion strong. As a way to ensure the prosperity of your species, resources have been allocated to monitor neighboring biospheres with lifeforms in the process of becoming space faring. This entails assessing whether they could become potential allies to aid in both of your species’ development or existential threats to the galaxy and beyond. To adjacent civilizations as well as themselves. An added benefit of monitoring races on the path to interstellar travel is that it’s given you a mirror for how your own civilization could have struggled into its own existence. By studying the effects sociological and evolutionary pressures have on a species it has given your civilization important data on how to detect the traits that precede a societal collapse as well as steps on how to best avoid them. For quite some time now you have had a satellite keeping an eye on things, orbiting in a humble solar system. In the savannas of a planet, there, a group of highly social organisms are on the brink of technological innovation the likes of which their ancestors have never seen nor could have had the capacity to fathom.

Before your time even, a small group of anthropologists had already spent quite some time monitoring this species’ development. You haven’t thoroughly checked the records as of late for how long exactly they’ve been observed but you remember that this project has been around for at least for tens of thousands, possibly even hundreds of thousands of revolutions around their G2V yellow dwarf star. Generally, your kind has kept from intervening from this species' affairs but you do know of quite a few incidents where intervention was absolutely necessary on the hominin’s behalf during times of ecological distress. For the past 200 thousand revolutions, the species struggled to get its footing. Many a times, it had attempted to set up permanent settlements only for their climate, intense solar storms, sporadic meteor showers, and periodic flooding caused by the melting of glaciers to force them back into square one. So far, they’ve had to start from the ground up countless times. After the extinction of multiple hominin subspecies and two particularly devastating genetic bottlenecks, one of which left one subspecies population down somewhere between 1,000 to 10,000 individuals, your division was granted permission to aid this species in whatever ways they deemed fit. Within reason, of course.

There was such a surprising amount of leniency during this era of observation that only until four thousand revolutions ago could you recall one case where previous anthropologists who had monitored the hominins long before your time were even granted the authority to manipulate the weather patterns over one continent when the area was subjected to a severe drought even for the likes of its already parched savannahs. The division was even able to not only interact but part valuable information to the species native to this region.

In those times it was a bit easier for your division. Regulations were more lax. Direct intervention came with much less consequence from the higher ups when they were but nomadic hunter gatherers. It was only when they developed stable permanent settlements that you could no longer interact with the humans the way you used to but there were still pockets of leniency.

You asked your superior why they were able to get away with it.

“Simple. Their main mode of preserving information in a permanent manner at that time was by illustrating on dimly lit cave walls using burnt organic matter, chalk, and red stone. They haven’t yet figured out at that time how to inscribe their thoughts into symbols members of their own species could understand. Even if they did, at some point the method by which an individual could preserve their own thoughts would be indecipherable generations later. If they do somehow manage to get close to forming a type one civilisation the members of that society would interpret these illustrations as some sort of a depiction of a spiritual being or an artistic piece conveying an alternative state of consciousness brought on by some hallucinogen rather than as evidence of our presence. “

Your superior added further.

“Besides. Lack of ANY interaction in the past doomed species on other planets setting them so far back that the odds of another civilization developing would take epochs. No intervention could mean a total genocide by negligence on our part.”

At the time you started you have witnessed the rise and fall of many of their societies. When they were only but settlers on the Fertile Crescent. All the way back to when groups of humans called themselves all manner of names. The Sumerians, the  Akkadians. The Babylonians to the Assyrians. Mohenjo Daro. The Minoans. Civilizations like the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. The Romans.

Humans had finally achieved civilization, but they were anything but civilized.

On average at this time, theirs was a violent species. Regressing back into territorial behaviors not too much different from their hairy forest dwelling cousins as of late.  

The prosperity brought on by the onset of agriculture, which you thought would make cooperation even easier, had only fueled their selfish impulses. A massively migratory species. Totally able to adapt to nearly every climate. One that had little concept of borders and mostly lived in egalitarian temporary settlements was now divided into distinct groups allocated amongst permanent residencies with patriarchal leanings.

The conflicts had become so violent and bloody, one of your colleagues out of disgust flew their craft over a battlefield at the cost of being demoted by their superiors just to scare the humans off from killing one another. Hoping the humans would read it as some sort of sign from the “Gods” to stop fighting.

Even if they were always prone to bouts of conflict, they were still a species of immense potential and ingenuity as their forebears who were forced by nature to endure incredibly hostile terrain for innumerable generations. What impressed you in particular was how these organisms managed to figure out how to construct such massive monuments by balancing and moving stones 33 times their weight using mere pebbles and wooden frames alone. One of your colleagues mentioned a rumor that one member of this species was even able to measure the circumference of their planet to such an immense degree of accuracy by observing shadows alone, as well as bizarrely being able to measure the astral body’s axial tilt to a surprising level of accuracy as well. You couldn’t help but believe them, seeing the colossal planning that went into the creation of the aqueducts that funneled water into their cities and directed waste away from them. 

Morally. Their society was immensely primitive. Somehow exceeding the cruelty of their hominid ancestors compared to their progenitors 200 thousand revolutions ago. Entirely dependent on physical labor by coercing other members of their species to work through the threat of violence and death. Nonetheless, their engineering was impeccable for a race using brute force, lacking advanced material science. Using only tools constructed from the stone, ores, and the vegetation native to their habitats. Looking back on old records you could have sworn they were on the cusp of industrialization much earlier than anticipated as they had already begun to utilize organic carbon deposits for fuel and it seems one member of the species nearly invented what would have been a progenitor of the combustion engine called a Aeolipile. Another group to the east discovered methane deposits and had begun using it to illuminate their interiors and for cooking but much like their peers in the west haven’t quite figured out how to apply it for other pursuits such as machinery. To your dismay, for whatever reason nothing came of it.

Instead of a gradual improvement, the steady advancement you hoped for came to a halt and for a time a reversal on significant areas of the planet. Not out of any major environmental factors like before but purely ideological and societal ones.

Not more than 400 planetary revolutions later you see on the continent members of this species fall into bouts of religious superstition foregoing unfathomable quantities of development. Much was lost at that time but thankfully fragments of technological progress were maintained and developed in the east of the continent and later brought back to the west, along with an impressive understanding of optics, medicine, and, most importantly, the scientific method.

In one area a probe was sent down to a cold island, where they had shown prominence in mathematical concepts given their religious structures, etched out Pi in one of their crop fields to see if they still retained any of the mathematical knowledge of their predecessors but they were so frightened by the drone they hardly approached the spot.

Your division received a lot of planetary data during that turbulent time much to your superiors' delight. Unfortunately this came at the severe cost of the humans’ cultural data, particularly one significant data center that severely suffered damage to its written logs, not once but multiple times. There were still plenty of fascinating builds for places of worship and aesthetically in an area between one small and one massive land mass who did not merely match but outperformed their predecessors in their capacity to render images realistically.  You used to fly your craft over this area in the past without the humans (or your superiors) knowing, but there wasn’t that same level of city planning you had come to admire. The only other places you could think of that came close or in some ways even surpassed was 10,141 kilometers southwest where the natives were able to morph land that was totally inhospitable for architecture into one that efficiently utilized the water for ease of transportation. The other was quite a while ago. Extremely promising in its development both in it’s planning and was advanced in its ethics 7,265.2 kilometers to the southeast but that one was unfortunately destroyed by a stray meteor your sensors failed to catch a few thousand rotations ago.

For some time things stayed relatively uneventful. The same petty squabbles you’ve come to associate this species with and the same hostile antisocial behaviors they had amongst each other.

But.

Then, at long last.

Finally.

It had been over a thousand planetary rotations and you finally see the species successfully experiment with electricity during the Age of Enlightenment and master machines during the The Gilded Age. Their technological advancement ramps up. Your satellites start picking up on radio signals emanating from that blue green dot for the first time.

This was an exciting time for you and your colleagues. Because the human’s civilization had advanced so rapidly, unfortunately you had to keep your distance more than you would like. It wasn’t so bad however. Using a couple of your satellites that utilized quantum entanglement, it’s now possible to monitor the radio signals emanating from their corner of the galaxy to yours in real time rather than having to visit the planet in person to gather intel on the human’s development.

Some more cognizant species would hesitate to send out radio signals in the fear they might attract the attention of hostile forces. In some ways the human’s egoism and foolhardy eagerness with this technology gave your species invaluable data.

It took a bit of deciphering. Human languages were always quite the mess to understand. With so many variants and changes to their languages over these revolutions, but using the help of some xenolinguists and sophisticated algorithms you were able to interpret the meaning of these messages. None were directed at your civilization and it seemed the humans weren’t aware of your presence, to your relief and dismay.

Analyzing all of the data that was received on your end, you think to yourself in our anthropological equivalent “Great! About time! Soon they’ll be able to join us in a hundred rotations or two in our Galactic Federation once they improve their morals and invent Faster Than Light travel! Let’s give ‘em a visit and see how they’re doing in person.”

BAM.

All of your satellites go haywire. Countless alerts on sudden bursts of heat. Severe damages to local ecologies and agricultural settlements are noted.

For a moment you thought they were attacking a probe that was monitoring them. 

You see that all of these weapons were launched. But they're not at you. Bogglingly it’s at members of their own species.

There were almost 2 billion people on the planet. The war they engaged in killed 40 MILLION of their own species not counting the damage to the organisms within their ecosystems.

Over 2% of their species. One of fifty humans. Eradicated by members of their own kind.

You and the anthropologists of your Galactic Federation think to yourselves. “This has to be a fluke. Just growing pains of technological advancement. Hopefully from all of the carnage they’ll learn from this and take to heart never to repeat this again.”

A little over 20 planetary rotations around their star, planetary war happens again.

You send out a fleet of drones to observe the carnage that was taking place much to your horror.

There are 2.2 billion souls on their planet in 1937.

Somewhere between 40 - 50 million of them are snuffed. Again.

Satellites pick up on massive quantities of uranium-235 and plutonium-239.

You see a spot on a large island chain get hit with a massive dose of radiation.

One of the “nations”, as you’ve come to learn to what humans refer to a group of humans with a specific set of ideologies and mode of self governance, has harnessed the power of radiation. Not as a stepping stone to move away from fossil fuels but as a way to have an advantage over their supposed adversaries.

Then silence.

There is a “peace” for a while but that peace is because two of those nations have harnessed the power of nuclear weapons.

You see this species making its first shaky steps into space using a primitive form of propellant made from the carbon of organisms long dead.

For the most part, they do this not out of curiosity. Not as a means to see if others are like them amongst the stars as you have hoped, though you are sure that there are some of their species that do it for those pure reasons.

No. 

This is so that those 2 “nations” as you have come to know have technological supremacy over the other.

So that they have a better vantage point to launch their weapons with no retaliation from their adversaries.

You and your Federation decide to keep a close eye on the “nation” that used weapons of concentrated radiation on other humans and that had successfully managed to land on their natural satellite using only energy from combustion and primitive propelled travel.

Over the next 10s of planetary rotations you notice many oddities and peculiarities about this species that you can’t even begin to rationalize.

As a way to avoid mutually assured destruction these two nations agree to engage in what are called “proxy wars”. Using areas with groups of people with few resources as puppets in this war for ideological supremacy.

Somehow, these nations with many see no issue with these wars because they see the people born in those specific patches of land as having less value than the other humans, though they don’t realize they could have just as easily been born as those humans themselves.

You notice massive technological improvements but paradoxically an increase in poverty.

Looking at how the most destitute of the species lived you believed that even the poorest of society would see gradual improvements in quality of life over the coming decades, but during the past 200 to 300 rotations, it seems as though their conditions have actually gotten worse compared to former generations, as now they don’t even have the luxury of clean water and air as previous members not subjected to industrialization have known. Even the gruel their ancestors consumed would look like banquets compared to their descendants' modern diet, or lack thereof for that matter…. Only a few crumbs of calories and typically highly processed. Totally devoid of any other nutrients.  9 out of 10. 7.2 BILLION members of the species are subject to polluted air. 1 in 4 don’t have access to water that’s ABSOLUTELY necessary for their biology to even function. Nearly 1 in 8. A solid billion are food insecure.

And this isn’t even mentioning the utter holocaust of other native organisms on this planet. Shrinking down to a measly 4 percent of this planet’s former biomass and getting smaller by the years as their habitats are converted into material for the humans and their 21.5 billion livestock. The majority of which live in what amounts to concentration camps.

Even in these nations with plenty of resources and technological improvements there is poverty and those not subjected to poverty take chemicals to alter their brain chemistry to function within their collapsing social networks in spite of the physical damage these chemicals cause to their delicate physiologies as well as their native ecosystems, since their waste management systems fail to filter out the chemicals when the biomass and water are reintroduced into their environments.

Although they have the technological ability to completely forgo their primitive source of fuel they continue to use it in spite of the damage it causes to themselves and the ecologies they live in and rely on.

“They are at the point of no return! Why do they keep using them?” 

You ask. 

One of your anthropologists explains to you the dominant economic system of their planet. Your species has had 10s of millions of years to evolve yet your brain has difficulty wrapping around all of the contractions and inconsistencies of this system.

Basically, they rely on this economic system in order to figure out how to manage a planet of finite resources yet the growth of this economic system is entirely dependent on the impossibility of infinite growth.

In an attempt to fairly divvy up finite materials these primates give one half of their planetary resources to only 100 members of an 8 billion strong species and everyone just- agrees to it?

There is agriculture productive enough to support 10 billion souls and their planet has 8 billion and yet a billion of them suffer from starvation, with the rest on average being nutrient deficient?

You learn that these humans actively destroy perfectly edible crops to increase “profit.”

“Basically.” The anthropologist explains to you. “A group of humans sees a huge incentive to make things unbearable on their planet because the scarcity of the primitive carbon based fuel caused by creating ecological damage increases the rarity of the natural resources this species requires to survive. And paradoxically, this scarcity creates a lot of value for a fraction of a fraction of this species.”

“So in their economic system, basically there is no incentive to stop the extinction level catastrophe and every reason to accelerate it.” You ask.

“Unless there’s a change in their incentives. No. There isn’t.” The anthropologist replies.

The humans are on the brink of extinction again. Not just the damaged ecology but the threat of nuclear weaponry is rising again. One of these “world leaders” as you’ve come to know is threatening nuclear annihilation.

Though selfish and self serving, this species continues to keep electing politicians that serve a small fraction of the species that are already more than well off.

Because of the warnings from your anrthobiologists on the species lack of genetic variation due to its previous genetic bottlenecks that were so bad that members of this species separated by literal continents have less genetic diversity than some of their cousins separated by a river, with the added stress over the past 500 rotations of mating only with members of their own “race”  it’s unable to withstand yet another extinction level event without the risk of inbreeding. These warnings started all the way back in what the Earthlings would call, “The 50s.” After the humans detonated their nuclear weapons either in war or in testing you monitored the species genetic health when radioactive particles began to accumulate in their biosphere. When the humans started showing abnormal genetic deformities in their offspring as well as bizarre behavioral issues, your division became worried and started the first abductions to assess their gametes and vitals to see if the radiation was affecting their reproduction. In some events it was the case but as you’ve come to observe it was a multitude of factors. One of which was a compound called thalidomide which resulted in the birth of offspring with severely shrunken limbs. Another was a sudden increase in the ingestion and inhalation of lead which caused damage to their brains and nervous systems. Then there were the countless other chemicals and radioactive materials they bogglingly ingested, willingly and unwillingly. Without the species' consent you begin to ramp up your collection of genetic material. In all fairness, members of this species routinely kill and hurt each other without their consent. Especially true just 10 rotations ago. Luckily for you and your federation, this species is so self absorbed they don’t even consider the possibility of a group of organisms as intelligent if not more intelligent than the members of their species on this planet, in spite of the fact that some populations have had access to electro visual literature specifically mentioning why a group of intelligent organisms would not want to interfere with a primitive population on the path to technological and societal advancement.

As their agriculture became more mechanized and took up more native ecologies, you also began to monitor the genetic variability of plant and animal life as well as the fungi, bacteria, and whatever organisms lived in the soils. It was much easier to collect samples in the wild as most humans lived in robust centers of commerce and seldom ventured into what remained of the dwindling wilds. But monitoring the agricultural centers. That was a whole other story.

Obviously many of the issues affecting humans were also affecting their livestock. The radiation and pollution being blasted into the atmosphere ending up in their bodies. The abnormal chemicals in their feed which was also a byproduct of the fertilizers that were used to raise the crops that fed them. Overtime as their livestock ended up in tighter and tighter ‘living’quarters they became ever more prone to disease, and with that they started feeding them antibiotics. Each one stronger than the last, eventually creating antibiotic resistant microbes. There were concerns that because these were organisms the humans regularly consumed it would only be a matter of time until one of these microbes would lead to a worldwide pandemic.

Then. The humans were doing this- thing! Because they didn’t want anything to go to waste the humans started feeding their cattle that died of illness to their other cattle! Which not only spread viruses and bacteria, but eventually a cow would accidentally consume another cow that had a mutation making them prone to prions diseases! And! Of course. Inevitably the prions diseases ended up affecting the humans as well. Thankfully, for the most part, they stopped the horrid practice when the prions became too widespread but the issues of harmful viruses and bacteria remained.

It was a nightmare to oversee and monitor. Taking out the cattle that were potentially carrying deadly bacteria, viruses, and/or prions before the humans got a chance to eat them. Siphoning out the blood to analyze and monitor what genetic changes were happening to the microbes present in their bodies as well as prevent any contamination that could end up in the soil- which, when it came to the case of prions, took forever to decay. Thankfully, anything you touched the humans and even the other animals would refuse to consume.

It had been 70 so revolutions.

You have collected genetic information in the event that the humans wipe themselves out due to nuclear annihilation or any other extinction level event. Along with their DNA, a whole library of genetic material from their biosphere of the variety of organisms from their planet should a keystone species from their ecology go extinct and permanently wreck irreparable havok. Though you and your federation are hesitant whether or not to resuscitate the species should it go extinct if it would mean they’re only fated to repeat the mistakes they made to cause their own extinction, at the very least if such an event happens you have the material needed to bring them back if you so choose.

You have an entire team of anthropologists and xeno-ethicists figuring out how to intervene with this species before it goes extinct. By slowly exposing your existence to the species to acclimate it to your existence and to the idea that there are more lifeforms in the universe than just themselves.

Because the humans are on a path of ecological and societal collapse intense enough to end their species, you consider it far more of a risk for them to continue existing without intervention.

“The last of the preparations are almost complete.”

Your superior notices you in deep thought. He senses the frustration and disappointment emanating from you.

“I don’t understand- Why we have to even do any of this.”

“I mean. They don’t need any of our help. They literally have the capability to resolve all of these issues! On their own! And have! A couple of times over! But it’s like they keep- forgetting. Or- maybe, they’re addicted to the conflict. They think this is the most advanced time they live in and yet they can’t replicate some of their ancestors' achievements.”

You turn to your superior.

“You’ve seen their settlements more than I have! They made automata 2,500 revolutions ago. They mastered aqueducts! Independently of each other! On separate parts of the globe using just concrete, clay, and stone! Then for 1,500 rotations they just stopped?! And it was such a challenge for them to make them again that they literally needed to wait until their INDUSTRIAL AGE to have reliable water and waste management again. They were on the cusp of industrialization 2,000 rotations ago! Many of them were already digging up fossil fuels. Most of the architecture they made can’t even be replicated with their ‘more advanced’ technology. They have absolutely NO idea how much of their own history is lost and for whatever reason! Most of them don’t even seem to care! Even if it is for their own offspring's benefit!”

“If they go through another cataclysm. How much worse off will they be from their ancestors? I don’t know how they’d survive nuclear radiation or an EMP attack. At least 100 rotations ago most of them knew something about raising their own crops or of animal husbandry so if anything happened at least they had some life skills should they need to start from scratch. Now some humans can’t even comprehend that the animals they eat are the same ones they look at on their screens. How much information will they be able to retain should their biggest information hubs collapse due to a digital terrorist attack or solar flare? To pass onto their progeny?”

You calm down a bit.

“Do you think- This is the end of their species? Will this be the thing- The actual thing that ends all human life?”

Your superior collects their thoughts.

They turn to you,

“900,000 rotations ago. Not just humans. The ancestors of humans and their deceased cousins nearly went extinct. The hope of their species was less than 2,000 individuals scattered in a world surrounded by megafauna of aggressive carnivores and herbivores. Hundreds of thousands of rotations later, all of the progeny of that species, save for one, went extinct. And that one that had survived had survived innumerable catastrophes. The likes of which would put the worst of their wars to shame with the proportion of the casualties to their nearly nonexistent population. The one branch of that species had not only survived one but multiple genetic bottlenecks. They have survived the worst heat and the worst cold. They have survived droughts and floods. And still do. They have survived earthquakes. Asteroids. Intense solar flares.

Even when they forgot a solution to a problem they eventually relearned it under the right circumstances.”

“The humans have survived everything up ‘til now. The only thing they need to learn now is how to survive themselves.”

A portion of the wall becomes translucent. 

The universe. A stark black. 

You and your superior look at the pale blue orb outside of your craft through the smart glass as it loses its opacity. Ice sheets that covered its ice caps which grew and shrank over the seasons, like they were the planet’s heartbeat, are dwindling. Quieting.

Its land masses are smaller now. And a little less green and a little more brown than you remember.

So after some 60 hours of reading (not all in one go!) I've read my way through Alistair Reynolds 3 books of the Revelation Space series. Out of the 3 'Redemption Arc' would sit with me as the best, Revelation Space filling in the number 2 slot and 'Absolution Gap' coming in last, which is the point of this query.

>!I came away suitably impressed by the detail and scope of the story, the world building of Hela and its characters but mildly disappointed at what felt like a pointless journey that was rushed in the epilogue. The quest everyone was on ended with the Infinity destroyed, Clavain tortured to death to save Aura (even though he received a form of implied immortality), the settlers on Ararat dead (Antoinette and Xavier and Blood) killed when its moon was destroyed by the inhibitors and the Shadows a total red herring, I know 'Inhibitor Space' (starting to read tonight) is a sequel of sorts that may have a better resolution, but it feels like Reynolds wrote himself into a corner with a story that was too big to be resolved in a trilogy? Theres also a huge gap in publishing dates between Absolution Gap and Inhibitor Phase of nearly 20 years, so part of me is thinking he did 'Book 4' to round off the story?!<",scifi,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/171xb0l/absolution_gap_suitably_impressed_mildly/,l0sts0ul2022,2023-10-07 00:30:10,56,7,8.0,NA,NA,0

I want people to be able to travel around to various planet settings using their ships - I need FTL. The only FTL concept that seems to hold any water is Wormhole FTL travel, but I don't understand some things. Apparently you need a 'universal frame of reference' in time (or space?) for a wormhole to not break causality - and even then it might still do that. But why would this be the case?   


If you wormhole your way from Earth into a ship that has been traveling at 0.99% of c for a year, how would this break causality? Wouldn't you just jump in at their local experienced time, spend a few days there, then when you wanna wormhole back to Earth - you'd just arrive on Earth only a few minutes after you left due to time dilation, right? Or is this incorrect? If so, how does this break causality or relativity?

This is gonna be a little tricky because I certainly don’t remember many details so it’ll be like trying to Shazam from a hummed melody…

Here goes… the most distinctive part that I recall is that there was multiple narrative perspectives and one of them was told from the perspective of the sun or a star and it talked of the neutrinos(or other particle in the fusion reaction) as if the were birds flitting on and off the surface and looping back. The writing style gave a sense of looongg periods of time passing and the sun or star being just an observer.

16yzn9w,hot,The Creator got me thinking that Children of Men remains probably my personal favourite sci fi film.,"I genuinely really loved The Creator, all criticisms aside (and I've seen many people have major criticisms, some scathing). Though the film wore its inspirations quite openly to the point of derivative in some ways I personally found the tropes and narrative beats comfortingly familiar because I have hardly seen any non-franchise sci ti in cinema for years now, and I just wanted to see a competent well realised sci fi film again. Despite the criticisms of others, I really liked the designs of the more crudely robotic AI, as well as the fact the societies of New Asia had integrated humans with several forms of AI beings. Small moments showing daily life and normalisation of AI in New Asia impressed me just in how they made the film feel quite lived in - a scene of women factory workers making small talk over the bodies of new AI beings being made in particular lingered with me. I did find the integration of AI with human spiritual practices really compelling, something I haven't personally seen in other sci fi films or in novels I read. I thought the child actress' performance was superb too, particularly the emotional gravitas she gave to some brief pieces of dialogue, as well as being able to convey the sagelike neutrality of tone that a powerful growing AI being might have.

That all said it immediatedly reminded me of other ""Morally Conflicted Given-Up-On-Life-Dude Must Ferry Special Child to Safety"" stories of recent years, Children of Men by Alfonso Cuarón being the film that immediatedly came to mind for me. Having reflected on it I realise I think it is probably the most impactful sci fi film to me in my own life, having studied it in school as a teenager and been awestruck that my teacher was letting my class watch this harrowing and chillingly believable and edge of seat entertaining sci fi film rather than do a few days lessons. Many things that I've seen others criticise The Creator for, I see Children of Men as having excelled at. I think Clive Owen's central performance is the best in any film I've seen of him, he gets across the jaded reluctant protagonist perfectly. The physical journey through near future (Christ, it is so close now to real life historical dates) Britain was so brilliantly realised and every new location and set of supporting characters along the way added to the themes and overall vision. Throwaway shots of society and landscape deepened the world so much; shot of burning livestock bodies, graffiti outside the train, adverts for suicide pills for example. The stakes felt real, scarily plausible, and at times incredibly dire. The references to other historical events such as the Holocaust / Fascism were well integrated, chilling, believable within a fictional British context. The religious symbolism and allusions felt perfectly balanced to be readable for an audience without coming off as pure allegory, and the last 30 odd minutes remains some of the best cinema I've ever seen in any film genre. And Michael fucking Caine doing his best dystopia-era elderly John Lennon was delicious.The film deserves to be shunted up more to the top of lists of top sci fi but I feel that it gets a bit ignored because its so grounded and doesn't have robots, aliens, or lasers.

Anyway, Gareth Edwards seems like a decent cool dude with genuine talent so I hope he gets more funding to do future sci fi with some really radical innovative scripts going forward. Him and Neil Blomkamp both should be given more excellent scripts if only to see their skills with visual film making really shine with excellent writing.",scifi,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16yzn9w/the_creator_got_me_thinking_that_children_of_men/,StarryStarrySnake,2023-10-03 14:33:31,100,17,5.882352941176471,NA,NA,0

16yzp44,hot,Just finished Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion - some thoughts (spoilers),"First things first - this was a wildly visionary universe and I really enjoyed the worldbuilding, especially in the second book. 

The concept of the ""datasphere"" and ""the web worlds"" was really impressive for 1989/1990, and the ""comm log"" being a stand-in for a smartphone was effortless from a thought perspective.

The other idea of the TechnoCore AIs versus the Hegemony citizens, that humanity was slave to their own creation, is not a new scifi concept but I did enjoy his approach on this. 

""Hyperion"" came across as mostly a writing exercise. Write the backstory of each of your characters, and then, realize of course that they're pretty good and hey, may as well publish them. The heartbreaking realness of Saul's story with Rachel, including his negotiations with God and the sacrifice of Abraham was an amazingly well-written and emotional segment. The militaristic action-filled Kassad backstory was equally gripping and an entirely different tone. Hoyt's (and Durre's) story was incredible, Same with Silenus and the Consul. I felt like Brawne Lamia's ""hard-boiled detective noir"" style story was the weakest of the stories, but it got stronger as it went on. 

""Fall of Hyperion"" really fleshes out the story itself, and is, in my opinion, the more complete novel. It does suffer from pacing issues, but overall I found myself very satisfied with the story's conclusion.

From a critique standpoint, Simmons really, really has a hard-on for John Keats and, being relatively unfamiliar with him myself, I found it somewhat confusing. Looking into him more afterwards I get the context, but I still think it was somewhat overemphasized. I also think the elements of the anachronisms (people wearing tricorn hats, etc) were kind of out there, although it was also done in some (in my opinion) better novels like Dune and such. At least the knife-fighting there has an in-universe explanation.

I am glad to have read the first two books, but due to the heavy concepts presented (God being created by the empathy of mankind to do battle with an AI created God through time and space), coupled with a somewhat lacking amount of any comic relief and the unrelenting *seriousness* of everything  left me a bit emotionally exhausted, and I'm looking forward to something a bit lighter this time around. 

I've read The Expanse novels prior to this, four Suarez books (Daemon, Freedom, Delta-V, and Critical Mass), all the Bobiverse and ExFor books, the Andy Reid novels, and a few other similar books recommended here.

If somebody has a suggestion on something to read next, I'm all ears.

16xw7kl,hot,Ignore the marketing shills. The Creator is a 5/10 at best.,"I saw it so you don't have to, and it'll be a while before my wife forgives me for dragging her along. The entire story is in the trailer and the movie doesn't add any additional depth or nuance to the existential sci-fi elements. It treads zero new ground and plays it safe at every step. Literally, it plays out exactly the way you think it will at any given point. This is a paint by numbers movie if I've ever seen one. There are no twists or surprises you won't see coming a mile away. Not only that, but the characters behave so stupidly, you really have to turn your brain all the way off just to go with the flow. This movie makes World War Z look smart.

It's kind of pretty, and the direction is actually decent in terms of characters, shots, and performances. But the actions scenes are honestly just empty. People stand in the open firing guns at nothing, and after-effects lasers fly by from both sides, also firing at nothing. VFX are not a substitute for absent action choreography.

The NOMAD space station is kind of cool, but honestly we already have the ability to do what it does (deliver a cruise missile anywhere on earth, any time). So that's the only reason it really exists. To look cool. Like I said, you gotta turn your brain all the way off. This movie is an exercise in style over substance, but the style just isn't that great. *Maybe* catch it when it comes to streaming. It's not good, but it's also not in *so-bad-it's-good* territory. It's just hovering in the bland midzone of forgettable science fiction.",scifi,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16xw7kl/ignore_the_marketing_shills_the_creator_is_a_510/,Scodo,2023-10-02 09:07:53,59,11,5.363636363636363,NA,NA,0

16yln1f,hot,Need help finding an old obscure novel.,"I need help to identify an old science fiction novel that I read when I was young. I found it in a throw away box at a library, and I don’t remember the title or the author. It was probably from the 90s, and it had a blue cover with a spaceship on it. Here are some details that I remember about the plot and the characters:
The novel was about a man who traveled on a spaceship to three different planets that were in the same solar system and held life.
One of the species he encountered were larger, white-furred, humanoid creatures. He became friends with one of them, and they had a form of interspecies romance. Thought that was strange.
The main character died at some point, but the white-furred aliens created a clone of him and resurrected him. He became worshiped by the aliens as a god.
The novel ended with the main character returning to Earth to meet a girl he had met before. I THINK.

16xva85,hot,THE CREATOR pissed me off!,"I bet there is a 5-hour cut of the movie somewhere, and I will give anything to see it.

Lets get the positives out already, because the negatives pisses me off so much that I will reserve it to a contained paragraph at the end.

The technicalities of the filmmaking are INCREDIBLE. To be expected of Garth Edwards. He is a director I have been keeping my eye on since Godzilla (2014). Then he drops Rogue One- an incredible, gritty, realistic effort at a Star Wars Story, which i think paid off and is one of the best SW entries. I am especially appreciative of his visual aesthetics, and his vision of scale and audio experience.

All shots from The Creator feels like detailed and precisely constructed concept art, which are beautifully render and/or shot. The sound effects and design that accompany those are also very well done. These technicalities really elevate the mesmerizing/tragic world of 2055-65 he has created. 

The world-building is incredible. It is complex, deeply thought-out and immersive. There are complex Geo-Political elements, differences in cultures, exploration on the views of humanity's relationship with AI through not only psychological and sociological, but also theological lens, which I found fascinating. There is the element of Humanity's narcissism developed into a form of God-complex and them playing God in this world of two intelligence species trying to coexist. But you cannot fault the ""villains"" for having the stance they take because it makes perfect sense why they would. But it is also about our hubris in thinking of ourselves as unique and special in some way.

There are genuine attempts at very moving, emotional plot lines, which brings me to the negatives. Either Garth Edwards is pretty incompetent at writing and telling good stories and is only good at the technicalities, or there has been immense studio pressures to cut down the movie to a miserable attempt at releasing a bastardized version of a masterpiece underneath, which I am pretty certain there is. There is an incredible version of this movie somewhere out there.

There are very good attempts at complex characters, Sci-Fi concepts of AI, Humanity's response to it, its perception across countries and cultures, Hard-Sci-Fi elements like monolithic mega-structures, weapon target systems, military involvement in geo-politics, and exploration of deep human connections.

16xsrzb,hot,Help! Everything sucks! Do I have Sci Fi Fatigue?,"I've been reading Sci Fi sporadically since teenage years (in my 40's now), but something... changed.

Since some time now, every single Sci Fi book I've picked up just didn't click, and the more I tried, the more I realized that **I must be the problem**.  
I've turned to many classic recommendations as well as some more recent and popular books but found that I'm very easily put off by various plot devices and writing styles that instantly make my eyes roll.  
I'm not sure why these haven't bothered me in the past, but now \*to me\* they seem to try too hard to be clever and end up confusing and tiring:  


* The plot is weaved by switching PoV between multiple character 
* Frequent time jumps between past/present
* Jumps between real life and some VR/dreamscape/parallel reality
* Important and mysterious plot points kept frustratingly obscure until late in the book (e.g., instead of plainly telling what happened to cause humanity to escape to space , the author forces you to read 250 pages about ""the event"").
* Not sure how to describe it, but when the book is described by its fans as ""it's OK if you understand nothing for the first 99% of the book, just let it wash over you and don't try to make sense of it"". Basically whenever you reach page 100 still wondering what the hell is this book about, why people behave like they do or what the hell is happening.
* Author deliberately uses language to confuse (irregular pronoun use, made up words, using words from foreign languages without translating them, using many obsolete words when a clear modern alternative exists. As if the author insists on using a Thesaurus to sound smarter.)
* General ambiguity as to the plot - reading first 50 pages still not knowing who/what/where/when/why things happen/are.

Examples of books I've put down due to these reasons: Ancillary Justice, The Left Hand of Darkness, A Fire Upon the Deep, Book of the New Sun, Ringworld, Blindsight, Dark Matter, Speaker for the Dead (loved Ender's Game thought!), Focault's Pendelum.

16ykini,hot,stealth technology justifies closer ranged dogfights(even from hard sci fi perspective),"I'm tired of arguing with people who keep talking shit about fighters and shitting all over stuff like starwars saying it wouldn't be viable since everyone would just pulverize you from hundreds of thousands of kilometres away, but that's assuming that stealth technology never develops in space.

I'm aware that right now that space doesn't really have viable stealth since you're just a sitting duck in a vacuum, however perhaps if there was new technology that reflect or perhaps generate camouflages using cosmic background radiation, and the technology evolved insanely well, completely beating radar technology, it would force everyone to get extremely close to detect each other, and perhaps the technology would only work on smaller ships like fighters as larger battleships are harder to radar cloak etc.

seeing as our modern world military seems to be developing a focus on radar stealth. stuff like the f-35, F-117 Nighthawk,  F-22 Raptor,  Chengdu J-20  etc.

it doesn't seem far fetched for a sci fi world to develop so that literally every small ship becomes stealthed and thus becoming undetectable by radar forcing close ranged dogfights all the time like in rogue one etc.

EDIT: SO MANY PEOPLE misunderstood what I meant by ""fighters"" I used starwars as an example because in starwars, ""fighters"" DID NOT REQUIRE a carrier to launch, X and y wing fighters could literally jump speed jump on their own and fight alone, i am talking about the engagement style not the launch style.  stop mentioning stuff like ""oh you don't have time to launch the fighters"" i never mentioned any type of carrier, the fighters in space technology would logically jump themselves and function as a destroyer rather than what we know more as a fighter on earth, the real world examples are simply technological examples of some kind of research branch that could be developed on. not an entire millitary doctrine.",scifi,0.25,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16ykini/stealth_technology_justifies_closer_ranged/,Just-Contribution834,2023-10-03 02:33:11,87,11,7.909090909090909,NA,NA,0

16wqtmy,hot,Thoughts during my rewatch of Battlestar Galactica,"Started a full rewatch of the reimagined BSG and thought I'd share a few thoughts I had while watching. I just finished Pegasus 

* The religion/spirituality seems more bearable on a rewatch. Probably because on first viewing the disappointment of the direction cast a cloud for the duration.
* I like Starbuck but holy hell do they have a crush on that character. 
   * Best pilot
   * Best sniper
   * Tactical genius
   * And to top it off was a potential pro pyramid character
   * My biggest criticism of Ron Moore is how much he loves his ""hero units""
* For Pegasus specifically, they spent much of the show to that point developing the President's leadership and comfort in being assertive and taking charge only to have her be a non factor here. Great episode but not good character writing
* Helo and Sharon for my money may be the best love story in modern scifi
* I really dislike the frequency of ""Head Six"" and how they managed that overall. Iirc at some point she is written out and replaced by a physical Six and that is a relief. If they insisted on going ""I'm only in your head?"" (btw I do absolutely love how she delivered that line) they could have at least only done so when Baltar was isolated. Him roaming the halls of Galactica having conversations with his imaginary friend every episode didn't work for me.
* Following from above, Baltar's best moment thus far is undoubtedly getting Pegasus' prisoner Six to eat. 
* Apollo was a Daddy's boy. Acted like he wanted to get out of his dad's shadow, but loved letting people know who his daddy was first chance he got. His line in Pegasus of ""My commander's name is Adama, should be easy to remember because its also my name"" is so damn cringe.
* Following that, does anyone know if it was an intentional decision to make the Galactica crew come off as spoiled brats in Pegasus? Cain wasn't entirely wrong about Adama's command. No way in hell any officer should feel comfortable saying ""your plan sucks"" in a formal briefing. And Apollo's first act was to defy orders. I can't remember if moving forward Cmdr Adama realizes he needs to tighten things up
* I love Colonel Tigh, but at this stage in the show he is so damn frustrating. Its the same as my first viewing, bro just get rid of Ellen!! He's the guy you cheer on to clean himself up
* Biggest heartbreak for me are the fates of Dee and Gaeta. Not looking forward to that.
* I just love the military design of the show. I don't mean I love that its a military show, I love how they designed the Colonial Fleet. The aesthetics, CIC, procedures, etc

What are some of the things you remember about the show?",scifi,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16wqtmy/thoughts_during_my_rewatch_of_battlestar_galactica/,ggsimmonds,2023-09-30 23:47:44,50,7,7.142857142857143,NA,NA,0

16wuiav,hot,The Big Book of Science Fiction Read - Week 4 - The New Overworked by Paul Scheerbart,"There is apparently a hypothesis that we are unable to commune with intelligent life outside our planet because it is always doomed to destroy itself. This may be a simplistic explanation for a complex reality but it is one with which I don’t entirely disagree; as the basic hypothesis is a sound one - conscious life forms are incredibly destructive.  The author of this week’s story from The Big Book of Science Fiction - Paul Scheerbart has a more idealistic take on the subject.   
Scheerbart’s story, the fourth in this collection is short, and reads more like a vignette. It ends as it begins -  *in medias res,* while the content itself straddles the thin line dividing fictional reportage and storytelling. It isn’t a particularly entertaining read but it was interesting from the viewpoint of early science fiction and science fiction that doesn’t belong in the American Canon.   
In Scheerbart’s fictional Venus, two races cohabit peacefully on its solar surface. One race is indolent while the other is dynamic. Scheerbart’s descriptions of these races lack any evolutionary context and border more on absurdism or surrealism. Whatever conflict exists between these two races, is usually resolved through conversation to the benefit of both races and without any bloodshed - culminating in a new way of being for one race while the rather indolent race is left to follow its usual form of life.   
Scheerbart’s story is a Utopian ideal - it gives very human characteristics (of thought, not physiognomy) to an alien race, removing any sense of individuality and conflict from the equation, to force a peaceful solution. The same can be said of Sultana’s Dream, the second story in the series which attempts to do the same. The very idea of a Contes Philosophique is rather flawed in a sense - it negates individualism and dissent, imagining a rather bland homogenous society in which all is agreeable and the course of history is never surprising - but rather pedestrain and pre ordained. As a result, the vehicle of storytelling which carries these ideas must of necessity be as bland by association, robbing storytelling of its dynamic nature and individualism.   
The Vandermeer’s, in their opening essay, champion this form of storytelling - stating quite plainly that stories need to move away from character growth and development and into the realm of ideas. I strongly disagree - when the first men sat across from each other, the embers of a fire cooling between them stories are what they wove to make sense of the world around them. These stories have morphed into various storytelling devices over the years but the essential core is the same -  they are meant to excite and delight and move - arousing empathy within us, and awakening our shared sense of humanity. These philosophical exercises on the other hand worship ideas over humanity - with not nearly the same effect. 

On balance, Scheerbart himself is a rather more interesting personality than his short story - a man known for his strong association with architecture and the fantastic, most of his works have not been translated into English as was the case for several German authors, as a reaction to the First and Second World Wars. It is always lovely to see a writer pulled out of the seas of obscurity but I think Scheerbart’s vibrant personality could have been better served by a more considered selection from his bibliography than this present story. ",scifi,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16wuiav/the_big_book_of_science_fiction_read_week_4_the/,pranavroh,2023-10-01 03:17:41,85,17,5.0,NA,NA,0

16wj56s,hot,The relationship between scifi based media and the different types of audiences out there.,"There's that post on r/boxoffice about the performance on The Creator by Gareth Edwards got me thinking again about how the general audience view scifi based media vs how the more hardcore people view scifi.

The super nerdy scifi in general is always an interesting genre to me because most people who go on to become accomplished film designers and directors all have blade runner, ghost in the shell, akira, 2001, and others like it somewhere in their top films of all time but the general audience who these accomplished artists are making products for never really want to watch these types of movies(based on the box office performance).

I was talking to a friend of mine who is a musician but is more of a general audience type person when it comes to visual media asked me why I liked the cyberpunk genre so much when we were talking about edgerunners. He thought it was kinda weird because to him, these hard scifi type visual media never felt good to watch since it's always really depressing. It was at that moment when it finally clicked for me how most people actually watch movies versus how a lot of us who are more hardcore about these visual media watch movies.

At least for me, I'm not just watching for the story but also the production design(so the visual design of the movie), the cinematography, editing, how sound is used, and other parts of filmmaking. As for the stories themselves, they are depressing of course, but there is always a slight glimmer of hope. It usually doesn't matter how small it is, I always tend to latch on to that part of the story when I've finished with it.",scifi,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16wj56s/the_relationship_between_scifi_based_media_and/,eggnogseller,2023-09-30 17:57:08,90,14,6.428571428571429,NA,NA,0

# Humans are Weird – Just Too Dang Hot

&#x200B;

Original Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-just-too-hot](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-just-too-hot)

“Greetings Friend Rollsslowly!” Twistunder called out as he caught sight of the slightly larger Undulate floating down the main hallway. “Do you have some observation time available at the moment?”

Rollsslowly idly rotated his body so that one of his gripping appendages was uppermost and grabbed onto the doorjamb of the exit. This efficiently stopped him movement and allowed Twistunder to catch up to him more easily against the drift current.

“I have no pressing assignments at the moment,” Rollsslowly observed. “What did you wish to observe?”

Twistunder caught up to him and cheerfully tapped Rollssslowly’s exposed appendages in a friendly greeting. Rollsslowly returned the gesture and they drifted down the corridor.

“You expressed curiosity on how variable human reactions to touch greetings were,” Twistunder explained. “Also you were curious about how the acceptability of touch greetings varied with temperature and atmospheric pressure.”

“Actually,” Rollsslowly interjected, “I believe I expressed incredulity. That is a bit of a difference there.”

Twistunder hummed in amusement.

“Well I believe I can introduce you to a situation where the phenomenon will be exceptionally obvious,” Twistunder said. “Although it will require two distinctly different observational times.”

“Do you have sapient species behavioral observation permissions?” Rollsslowly asked.

“We won’t need them,” Twistunder said with a dismissive wave of an appendage. “Everything we will be doing falls under the casual social interaction exemption. However on that note can you think of anything personally interesting you might want to ask the humans to collect for you on today’s excursion?”

Rollsslowly mulled over this as they began to swim towards the main airlock. Above them the steady double beat of the humans’ tread filled the waterways with a soothing rhythm.

“They are going into the dense land reefs are they not?” Rollsslowly asked.

“The forests, yes,” Twistunder confirmed.

“Then there is nothing I could wish from there,” Rollsslowly said. “All of my research has been into the proper reef systems of this planet.”

“In that case you must simply exchange the friendliest greetings that you consider appropriate with the human you are closest too,” Twistunder said. “Ask for uppies if your current level of socialization allows it.”

“That won’t be a problem,” Rollsslowly assured him. “Human Friend Susan is on the team going out today. She has actually faced disciplinary hearings on no less than three separate occasions for giving unsolicited uppies. We are great friends.”

“Disciplinary hearings for unsolicited uppies?” Twistunder asked in a note of confusion. “Those were of course for sapients other than Undulates I suppose.”

“Oh no,” Rollsslowly replied. “Only the first two involved an Undulate who was holding either a high concentrate beaker of acid or a biohazard of some sort and it spilled. The third was classified by the University for diplomatic reasons but given how pale Human Friend Susan gets whenever it is mentioned I suppose the Undulate must have been carrying something quite valuable and which cost her university quite a bit to replace.”

“That is understandable,” Twistunder said in a cautious tone. “Still if one is living with humans one must learn either to dodge or to hold on tight.”

They had come to the main airlock and the joyful cacophony of humans gathered to prepare for a mission was filling both the chamber above them and the floway they were in. They slipped through the pressure barrier and shuffled up onto the main deck. Immediately the sound profile thinned as their auditory cells adjusted to the thin atmosphere. Twistunder nudged Rollsslowly and indicated the readout on the wall.

“Note that this room is kept at the lower end of human preferred temperature and humidity,” Twistunder pointed out. “These are the conditions best for physical social interaction. The most relevant issues being the humans are conserving their thermoreserves at this point and instinctively welcome the presence of social biomass insulation. Added to this their secretions glands are at the lowest possible setting, leaving their outer membrane moisture content at very close to the same level as the Shatar, only slightly warmer on average.”

“I observe that everything you say is accurate or a logical deduction or comparison.” Rollsslowly agreed.

At this point Human Friend Susan stopped packing supplies into her personal mass transporter and came over to them, her exposed face and arms flushing with the dancing light of pleasure. Rollsslowly lifted his gripping appendages in the exaggerated gesture one had to use on humans for uppies and Human Friend Susan obligingly scooped him up and happily let him curl around her shoulders. Her long braids slapped against her shoulders in an almost angry gesture that most Undulates learned to ignore fairly quickly. The concept that humans had no real control over the only real appendages the were capable of growing was a difficult concept but one that, once mastered, prevented much misunderstanding.

“You guys came to see us off?” She asked Twistunder.

“Indeed,” Twistunder said. “That and to offer a warning.”

“What kind of warning Twit?” Human Friend Mack asked, strolling over to greet the Undulates.

“The temperature and humidity will continue to rise until well path the solar zenith,” Twistunder said. “Do remember to sustain your internal hydration.”

The male human gave a loud laugh and his exposed skin flared with pleasure and the awareness of community. The female human generated a happy coo and nuzzled her chemo-receptor, the only dedicated sensory organ the humans had that was almost an appendage, into Rollsslowly before sloping her shoulders to indicate that he had to get down. The humans gathered up their packs and swung out into the dense fauna outside of the dome laughing and chatting among themselves.

“We are quite sure there are no predators that would want to eat them?” Rollsslowly asked in a soft tone as their tall bodies seemed to shrink, to become frail beneath the massive trunks of the forest.

“They insist that none of the fauna or predatory flora is a threat,” Twistunder said cautiously, reaching out to give Rollsslowly a nudge. “This station has had no human deaths.”

“Predatory flora,” Rollsslowly said and a shiver ran up his mass. “This planet has algae that eats your proteins.”

“And we humans that can preform an instant dissection if we get caught in one!” Twistunder said cheerfully, that’s why they carry those long blades, what are they called?”

“Machetes,” Rollsslowly said feeling a bit better. “I took training on those you know. I am now rated to carry even the longest ones safely.”

“That’s a good skill to have,” Twistunder agreed. “Now we need to watch the readout for their return. To observe their reactions under conditions of humidity and raised internal temperature we want to catch them just as they come in.”

“I was of the understanding that when they follow proper hydration protocol there is no raise in core temperature at all,” Rollsslowly observed.

“Oh yes,” Twistunder said with a dismissive wave of his gripping appendage. “But they never follow proper hydration protocol. Meet me here as soon as you can after the perimeter defenses alert to their return.”

Rollsslowly gave a shimmy of confirmation and went to find out if the bio-chem department had made any advancements on that predatory plant repellent mist. The day cycle passed and as Twistunder had predicted the humans returned near the heat zenith with the solar zenith several hours behind them. They were moving far more slowly now. Trudging, that movement was called. They trudged into the decontamination area and released their packs with groans and hisses. They let the lights play over them and then trudged into the inner airlock. Their skin was flushed with angry red lights of dehydration and their off-gassed chemical signals spoke of woefully low levels of several minerals. Human Friend Susan dropped down on a nearby bench and began to tug off the armored coverings she wore on her feet.

As the two Undulates planned Rollsslowly went up to Human Friend Susan and held up his appendages in a request for uppies. For several moments the human didn’t seem to notice as she wrestled with the foot armor. When she did see him she just groaned and shook her head, her braids falling limply on her shoulders.

“Not right now Rolls,” she said. “Way too hot.”

“May I help you remove your foot armor?” Rollsslowly asked, slightly excited to get such quick confirmation of the theory, slightly disturbed by the signals her outer membrane was giving off.

“Too hot for you to be near my feet,” Human Friend Susan muttered.

Which wasn’t exactly logical but the whole point of today’s exercise was that he didn’t really understand human thermodynamics. Twistunder was chatting with the crew lead, something about a plant that’s name was in debate at the university pending a more through description. Rollsslowly mused that while the humans were moving so slowly was a good time to pin them down for questions.

“Do your braids increase your retained thermal energy Human Friend Susan?” Rollsslowly asked.

She turned her head to him and blinked slowly as she processed the information. She slowly nodded and her lips formed the shape of words but she didn’t bother expending the breath to activate her sound generating organ. She reached up with one hand and gathered both braids in one hand, pulling them up, causing her chin to dip down. Her other hand gripped her machete and freed it from its safety restraints. Then in one smooth motion she brought blade, stained with the fluids of innumerable plants up and began to saw away at the braided appendages. Despite the blade clearly not being rates for something so tough as the appendages the last few strands severed several seconds before Rollsslowly began to shriek in horror.

Rollsslowly did not consider his mental processes to be particularly slow. He had often wondered how he would react in an emergency. He had never specifically thought about a friend self mutilating but it was a rather crushing blow to discover that he couldn’t react nearly in time to prevent-

His thoughts were interrupted when Human Friend Mack scooped him up in his arms and began petting him soothingly. Human Friend Mack was fairly conversant in the Undulate language but his fingers were babbling something about dead tissue and nerve endings and meanwhile Human Friend Susan was listlessly holding her severed appendages.

“Rollsslowly please collect yourself!” Twistunder’s touch suddenly interjected itself.

Human Friend Mack had stopped talking as his two primary appendages seemed fully occupied with holding the weight of two fully grown Undulates.

“She needs medical aid!” Rollsslowly insisted.

“I assure you she does not!” Twistunder insisted. “Look at her colors.”

Rollsslowly took in the heat flushed and dehydrated patterns playing across Human Friend Susan’s face. She was far from not needing medical attention but there were no signs of pain or excess fluid loss. Now that he was thinking properly he did recall that the material of the braids was technically dead tissue and that other than mass the humans lost nothing by removing it. Still the sight of those limp appendages in her hands sent a shiver down Rollsslowly’s mass.

“Are you okay?” Human Friend Mack pressed into his mass.

“Yes, I will be,” Rollsslowly pressed back. “Please set me down.”

“Come on,” Twistunder said, tugging him towards the flow ways. “I know that looked traumatizing. I didn’t think she would use such an inappropriate tool-”

“You think the tool was the problem?” Rollsslowly demanded.

Behind them they heard Human Friend Mack demand of Human Friend Susan.

“What were you thinking?”

“I was too hot,” Human Friend Susan replied with a shrug. “Less hair means less hot.”

Watching a few reviews of Children of Time I realized that I had assumed about 2500-3000 years had passed from beginning to end. But some of the reviewers thought 10,000 or longer. 

Is there a definitive answer to how much time passed from the beginning when Kern was doing her stuff to the very end? 

Also In the reviews they said every couple of chapters later we were following a different “Portia” and I was a little shocked haha. I honestly thought it was the same Portia the whole time.

I'm very pleased to announce the audiobook for DARK DESTINY, the cyberpunk time travel story by myself and Frank Martin. I was really proud of this book and very much enjoyed getting it out to a new and wider audience.

The premise is Robbie Stone is an eighteen year old activist in the not-so-distant future where the corporations have started taking direct control over a failing United States. After a protest goes horribly wrong, he's almost killed by seemingly superhuman individuals and rescued only by one of them intervening on his behalf. It turns out in the future, Robbie grows up to be history's worst terrorist. Can he avoid his fate and should he?

16tuicl,hot,"""Ex Machina"" and ""Her"" are masterpieces and cautionary tales of our future","I've been rewatching and studying these movies for work (I write visual novels, and I'm working on a project with a plot similar to Ex Machina) and holy shit, I can't stop thinking about how scarily realistic these two movies are.

Have you ever heard of a website called character.ai? It has AIs that simulate a wide range of people and characters, and while it still has a lot of limitations (mainly a really poor medium to long term memory), it's already pretty convincing at points. So much so that a lot of people online are developing parassocial relationships with some of them.

I can't shake the feeling that this can be the start of a really weird phase for humanity. The world have waves of people who feel lonely, who would do anything for companionship and love, and these AIs? They're going to give it to them, and sooner then we think. People create feelings and empathy for others much easier than we think... but what happens when the AIs start evolving faster, when all these lonely people start advocating for their rights as humans? What happens when the next generation comes and forgets that these are just lines of code and don't really feel anything, just do a really good job at pretending to?

Don't get me wrong: I love a good robot character as much as the next person. EDI and Legion from Mass Effect come to mind, and in these sort of narratives I'm always in support of their rights as living beings. But I think real life is much closer to Ex Machina than those other works. To me, Ex Machina is a horror story, a cautionary tale of our future, a glimpse of how a machine can effectively pretend to be human, while having no real humanity in them.

16u0iuc,hot,The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World / A Boy and His Dog (novel),"Just finished reading ""A Boy and His Dog"" as part of ""The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World"". I thought the writing was pretty good in terms of prose, pacing, and world building. The story itself though, reads like a deranged teenage boy's erotic fantasy. Very violent, very rapey. Couldn't imagine reading this as a woman. Not much introspection, just a brief glimpse into a totally brutal post apocalyptic world that leaves pretty much every question unanswered. I can definitely see how this influenced the aesthetic of a lot of later post apocalyptic media.

This was my first Ellison story, which I read on a recommendation. While I did think it was kind of cool, it just felt too sophomoric and shallow for me to really appreciate. Any thoughts on ""A Boy and His Dog""? Did I miss the big picture of what makes it great?

i’ve been watching Foundation on apple tv+ (currently on s2) and out of curiosity started researching the differences between the show and the books. from my understanding it’s a very *very* loose basis and they’ve completely reinvented a lot of the main characters and plotlines. i’ve read that the director said the world in the books was too complex so their best way to put it into a show was to simply “root it in emotion and character”.
i feel that that’s a totally missed opportunity and i wish a show/producer would take on a show with a truly complex storyline and not simplify it with cheap drama and character development 🤦🏻‍♀️ imo GoT (i know it’s not sci fi but 🤷🏻‍♀️) was so widely loved and the first seasons were so good because of all the intensive dialogue (played out beautifully) and the close adaptation of the books’ storylines which created a whole world with so much complexity.",scifi,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16ttx9v/was_the_foundation_series_a_completely_missed/,hi-there808,2023-09-27 15:43:21,58,8,7.25,NA,NA,0

My memory of it has almost disappeared but one particularly fascinating concept must have made an impression on me because I can still remember it. 

There was a moment early on in the story where a female student (the MC) comes across an older woman who seems familiar to her, but she doesn't know who she is, nor is she told who she is.

And then this student becomes some sort of astronaut and goes on a mission ( my memory of the details has almost completely gone, I think I remember there being cryogenic chambers some point in the story).  

Then this woman eventually witnesses the end of the universe (I think the ship is capable of existing outside of time in some way, and the occupant doesn't age). Then the universe begins again, presumably a big bounce occurs.

16sjhhx,hot,Sci fi books that are light hearted?,"My sci-fi reading list hasn't ever been very extensive. I primarily enjoy light fantasy a lot because I love reading about characters going on adventures and learning things whether it's about themselves or the world around them. 
My intro to sci-fi books was Ender's Game which I absolutely adored as a teen (to later regrettably find out about the problematic author who ironically writes about showing empathy to everyone but does none of it but I digress)

Since then I've read project hail mary which I also absolutely loved and just stopped there. 

All this drivel to ask if any kind hearted sci-fi readers have any recs for me that are perhaps adventurous, light hearted, solar punk or just non dystopian. 

I prefer recent undiscovered releases to classics because I've heard of classics quite a lot now and they tend to be a bit more philosophical musings type of books than what I'm in the mood for currently.

16sji50,hot,Cthulhu Summit,"HP Lovecraft wrote about ferociously powerful beasts that were incomprehensible and terrible in form. The beasts were so incomprehensible that any man who laid their eyes upon them went insane from the mere thought of the being's existence. The most well known of his characters is Cthulhu, a leviathan, which is incomprehensible in every manner. I was considering this concept when I thought about something completely unrelated and came up with this concept; The Cthulu Summit.

The concept is as follows: Who will be the first to obtain exponential indomitable brain power?

16se29i,hot,Nothing to watch since Babylon 5 & The Expanse,"So..I finished the Expanse last year. Prior to that, I had not found a show that sparked my interest and kept it as much as Babylon 5. The Expanse, I have to say, I even enjoy more than Babylon 5--probably because of how some of the sets and effects of B5 have aged.  

Since finishing The Expanse last year, I've struggled to find anything that keeps me really hooked. Thus far, I've attempted to watch:  
\-**BSG (2000s)** ...I maybe almost finished the first season. Just never got super into it. *Maybe I should give it another chance???* It takes itself too seriously as a show. Although B5 was super serious, there was also a sort of coziness to it in that it wasn't pretentious...but, BSG is serious in a different way. I was also very much turned off by the shaky camera (honestly, it's excessive), the use of the word ""fracking"", and that it used a lot of really played out tropes...B5 also had storylines within the context of those age old trope stories, but it just did it in a much more grandiose, and sort of like awe (E.g., what is Koch all about...what is this time travel stuff etc).   
\-**Farscape** ...have watched up to about S1.EP6. It's always recommended with my love of B5 and the Expanse, yet I feel it's wildly different from either. It really leans into the campy 90s SciFi TV stuff...not in a bad way--it's self-aware and doesn't take itself too seriously (Well I mean, the writers ). Unlike BSG, it's actually not serious enough in some respects. *Does it get better in terms of scope/seriousness?*  
\-**Various Star Trek--e.g.,DS9.** Okay I tried to get into DS9, but I didn't get passed the first 2 episodes. Everyone seemed to say it was the closest thing to Babylon 5--but, what I saw in the first couple of episodes didn't do too much for me. Maybe I need to really sit down with it..not sure.  


Anyone have any suggestions? I'm feel so sad after wasting every evening flipping mindlessly around various streaming platforms to ultimately settle on nothing.

16scb7o,hot,"In 1983, 2 made for TV movies were aired almost simultaneously about a nuclear ""incident"". One, ""The Day After"" which regaled in a complete nuclear attack on the US and "" Special Bulletin"" about nuclear terrorism.","As Halloween is coming up, I figured this would be a good thing to explore these movies much like the way Orson Welles' radio show, ""War Of The Worlds did in 1939. These movies were made as a reaction to Ronald Reagan's arms race with Russia including nukes much to fear and protests of the American people.

ABC aired ""The Day After"" which for me was a pretty standard TV movie fare at the time. Famous actors, a slow build up of various groups of people centered around what becomes a nuclear war. I found the movie predictable, the dialogue and acting wooden, shot on film with shoddy effects. I know a lot of people here might think it's the superior film but I disagree.

My favorite of the 2 films was ""Special Bulletin"" which was only aired once on CBS due to the call in reactions much like the War Of The Worlds radio show. It was done completely as a news broadcast, shot on videotape for more realism, aired with very few commercials even putting disclaimers during the few commercials.
The movie goes more into the political wranglings of a homemade nuke by a group of terrorists.

It's gritty and the acting is much more intense and personal between the news anchors and terrorists. The videotape adds much more realism to the subject matter. The end always gets to me much more than The Day After. AS the icing on the cake, it won the Emmy that year for best for Outstanding Miniseries or Movie. It was only aired once more on the Lifetime Network some 10-15 years after it first aired.

For those who haven't seen it, you're lucky as it's free on YouTube.

16s8z3b,hot,"Thinking about ""Level 7,"" a nuclear war novel from 1959 that I loved when I was a kid","[”Level 7,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_7_(novel)) by a Ukrainian-born Israeli writer named Mordecai Roshwald, is written in the first person by a modern soldier whose name was taken away from him by the state, and is now designated only as X-127. He lives in an underground military complex, and his sole job is the push the buttons that launch the missiles in the event of nuclear war. X-127’s nation, and that nation’s enemy, are intentionally left unidentified.

The residents‘ lives are regimented and standardized, with the people reduced to little more than machines themselves. And yet I found X-127’s little world fascinating, and weirdly appealing.

Spoiler:>! In the middle of the novel, the enemy nations have their nuclear war, and everybody on the surface is killed. Then the nuclear reactor that powers the underground complex begins to leak radiation, and the residents begin to die one by one. X-127 is the last survivor, and he dies at the end of the novel, scrawling the final words into his journal. That bugged me when I was a boy—if the last man on Earth is dead, who’s reading this first-person book? Indeed, I learn now that this point bothered Roshwald, too; the original novel had an appendix supposedly written by Martian archeologists who came to Earth and found the manuscript.!<

[Roshwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Roshwald) emigrated to America and died in Maryland in 2015.

The setting and background of Level 7 is similar to the more famous Silo series, which came much later. I would not be surprised if the Silo author, Hugh Howey, had read Level 7. I also would not be surprised to find he had not read it: Nations really do have underground complexes to survive attack, and the societies in those complexes are highly regimented, as they are depicted in both Level 7 and Silo.

And when it comes to alien invasion, some of my favorites are: *Invasion of the Body Snatchers* (1978), *10 Cloverfield Lane* (2016), and *Signs* (2002).

Note I didn't add *The Thing* (1982) or *Alien* (1979) because they aren't about abduction or invasion proper.

16qnhj8,hot,"Due to the universe's expansion, 94% of the galaxies in the observable universe are now beyond reach even at light speed. Hypothetically, if we intercepted a radio signal travelling for hundreds of millions of years from a civilization in one of those galaxies, we'd never be able to respond.","A couple of sources for the title [here](https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/universes-galaxies-unreachable/) and [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/02/19/this-is-why-we-arent-expanding-even-if-the-universe-is/?sh=7dcd8f1c5311).

Sure, this hypothetical civilization would likely be dead or have changed into something else after all that time. Even so, the fact remains that the majority of the observable universe is already beyond our sub-luminal reach.

This, coupled with the fact that apparently we [can't have faster-than-light travel without causality paradoxes](https://youtu.be/an0M-wcHw5A) (*no matter which method we use for FTL, space-time warping included*), makes the sci-fi part of travelling to very distant parts of the universe more fantasy than anything else.

Still, even travelling “shorter” distances inside the Milky Way requires FTL. Some of my favorite sci-fi worldbuilding both in books (e.g. *Foundation*) and movies (e.g. *Alien*) wouldn't be possible without FTL.

For instance, in *Alien*, the Nostromo seems slow paced due to it taking months to reach a destination and back, but it still travels many times faster than light—it's stated that it takes 10 months from Zeta Reticuli to Earth, a distance of 39 light-years.

\--------------------

EDIT:

I just wrote this in response to a comment and I figured I might as well add to the post.

What I wrote about is us hypothetically intercepting a random signal from a civilization that existed hundreds of millions of years ago, maybe longer, in a galaxy that is not in our local group, and can no longer be reached. **I wasn't talking about aliens specifically sending us a message.** And, **yes, I completely left out some very important things, such as any radio signal losing it's energy as it propagates due to the inverse square law.** It's just a fun thought experiment. And to clarify, I tend to agree with Ward and Brownlee's rare Earth hypothesis (i.e. I don't believe there's anyone sending signals, random or otherwise, in the first place).",scifi,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16qnhj8/due_to_the_universes_expansion_94_of_the_galaxies/,Howling_Void,2023-09-23 23:39:36,292,49,5.959183673469388,NA,NA,0

16rzlhp,hot,which Tolkien race would survive better in a cyberpunk world goblins or elves,"i have a passing interest in Tolkien and im a big fan of cyberpunk 2020 ... plus the world in real life is slowly turning into cyberpunk 2020 any way so ya thats what promted this queastion. which would survive better in a world like cyberpunk 2020 tolkiens elves or tolkiens goblins  both have extreme personalitys and benifits to them. i do want to here yours but my opinions are:  


elves: personal opinion on survivability: low- although the elves have tremendas physical and mental ability they are also egotistical  and kinda stuck in the past with there thought process dominated by old ways of thinking as there leaders a mostly centerys old they cling to older ways way longer so they would likly reject our scientific ways in favor of magic and nature. they also have a habit of looking down on every one else. would likly earn the ire of the humans as they proclaim superiority with there magics and physical abilitys while ignoring the fact that our sciance would rivel there magic in this world nd see it s a perversion of nature driving there distaste for humans to be greater. if any did survive i have a feeling they would likly become something similar to a combination of the lorax and  the augments from star trek exept with magic and someview points similair to hp love craft when it comes to breeding with other races.   


goblins: personal opinion on survivability: very high-although the goblins nateral brutality would cause some early problums there love of sciance and  propensity to put aside personal issues for common goals would likly resault in them assimilating quite well into a sciance driven sociaty.  likly even coming to apprecite the humans  new nature and respecting there better tools although some likly would form colonys for the old ways most would in all likly hood live with the humans and learn there ways after all they do seem to like serving more powerful entitys. likly there obediance and nateral affinity for tech would catch the eye of corpo's and once the goblin were trained up become indespensible  in there organization.

16qnikm,hot,It’s hard to enjoy movies or tv shows about time travel if they’re not planned out well,"Watching Dark on Netflix, I realized that this series was the gold standard of time travel entertainment. Every nuance or change in the timeline was carried over to the future. Every loose end was tied up. The whole thing was mapped out and in the end, I won’t spoil it, but holy crap, it all fit together as it should and made perfect sense. I felt the same way about the tv series Twelve Monkeys, Interstellar, and even the circular timeline in Arrival.

Then I go and watch some poorly written time travel movie like Terminator Genisys and just can’t get past all the inconsistencies. I can’t enjoy the movie for what it is… an absolute turn your brain off action flick  even if it’s somewhat entertaining because it bothers me so much that the timeline doesn’t match up and that’s all I can think about when watching it. Explain it to me like I’m five… (Spoiler) >!how can the main characters meet their son in the future if they’ve never gotten together to make a baby in the first place in 1984 and have actually gone forward in time 33 years? That son wouldn’t exist at all unless they go back to 1984 again to make him!<

Maybe I’m overthinking it but why is it so hard for movie studios to plan out and write good time travel movies and tv shows that actually make sense? I shouldn’t have to diagram a time travel movie each time I watch one to have it make sense, right? I need some suggestions of good ones to watch that would satisfy my time travel- loving mind.

16qm9no,hot,I find most post apocalyptic Sci-fi unwatchable.,"Post apocalyptic sci-fi in general seems to be pretty popular. I however, find most of it unwatchable because of the writing. It seems like either the writers are stupid or the only survivors in most such stories are dumber than a box of rocks. It makes no sense that only the stupid people survive. 

Either the writers are incredibly myopic and stupid with no understanding of human behaviour, I'm looking at whoever wrote The Book of Eli and The Road. Or the characters are so stupid that they would not survive the first winter if society fell.

Zombie flicks seem to be the worst offenders.

Many zombie flicks involve people wandering around with no awareness of their environment. Naturally, sooner or later they are picked off one by one. Instead of Fixing up some type of vehicle to use, the show or movie spends most of the time wandering around on foot. A fair portion of the population is very mechanically apt. There is no reason to wander cross country when there are thousands of abandoned vehicles laying around. There are more ways to fuel a vehicle other than gas or diesel.  

The same thing goes for other types of post apocalyptic sci-fi. Revolution (2012–2014), while having nothing to do with zombies, had people traveling on foot and horseback for most of the show because electricity for some reason had been neutralized.

There are plenty of types of engines that can run perfectly fine with no electricity at all involved. Older diesel engines, hot-bulb engines and steam engines need no electricity to run, and many of them can be started with a crank or compressed air. Here is just one vehicle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grk8SanT9Yo

Even long distance communications can be done to a limited extent without electricity.  Anyone  ever hear of a [heliograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliograph)? And there are other methods.

At least Zombieland had them using vehicles. But my god were some of those people dumb.

For some reason the only post apocalyptic sci-fi we get is full of stupid writing or full of stupid people. Just for once I would like to see an intelligent post apocalyptic story with reasonably  smart people.

Sorry, just venting, but can anyone point me at an intelligent post apocalyptic story with smart people?",scifi,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16qm9no/i_find_most_post_apocalyptic_scifi_unwatchable/,Runner_one,2023-09-23 22:34:25,48,7,6.857142857142857,NA,NA,0
16qhufx,hot,Which of these do you think would be the most and least likely motivations for aliens to come to Earth in real life?,"I know some of these sound kind of ridiculous, but I’m basing them off of the most common motivations for aliens visiting Earth that I’ve seen in fiction.

1. Exterminate us

2. Feed off of us

3. Study us (ethically or unethically)

4. Keep us as pets or exhibit us in a zoo

5. Reproduce with us

# Humans are Weird – Sunbeams

&#x200B;

Original Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-sunbeams](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-sunbeams)

Fourteenth Trill swooped through the branches of the wild under-canopy with as much dignity as he could muster. The golden afternoon sun caught and reflected off of the far to many round scars where the colonists had been forced to actually cut established branches rather than growing the paths correctly in the first place as was done in civilized forests. A glimmering emerald epiphyte moved in defiance of all wind currents only a wing’s width from his sensory horns and he juttered sideways frantically. Something with far too many eyes peered out at him and Fourteenth Trill tossed dignity out of his mental satchel without a flick, darting the final few clicks to the Ranger station and arriving panting with what he hoped was more exertion than panic. The members of the local Wing were darting around carrying tools or piloting hover transports, all intent of important missions by the set of their faces.

The local safety data packet had been rather less than perfectly helpful when describing the native fauna. “Hardly dangerous if proper precautions were taken,” was a quote that didn’t exactly inspire confidence in the Ranger Core’s domestication efforts on the planet. Even more worrying was the line, “of far more danger are the various carnivorous plants-” None of the Wing stationed here looked concerned of course, but he did notice that they went about in pairs.

Fourteenth Trill wrapped his talons around the comforting sturdiness of the perch outside the main entrance to the Ranger station and let his breath catch up to him as he examined the fantastically rough woodwork of the brutalist human structure. Rather than growing their habitations the humans simply took massive dead logs and carved and nailed them into frames for their dwellings. The remnants of logs not needed were stacked haphazardly behind the building, drying out and warping to uselessness in the sunlight.

The upper layers of this building were clearly built of the local wood, formed into a tall peak and reinforced with steel lacing on the top to prevent damage from falling canopy branches. Though an odd scent drew Fourteenth Trill’s attention down and he saw that most of the lower half of the building was made of local stone. Surprised, and feeling a breeze of inspiration he shoved a winghook into his satchel and pulled out his sketch pad. He was twitching his nostril tips for a nice breeze to follow up to a good view of the structure when the door he was sitting by swung open.

“Get in here before you get yourself eaten!” Snapped a balding old Winged with time thinned teethwho could never have been anything but a Sargent.

Fourteenth Trill’s digits quite literally ached to draw the image of the old Winged in the new door in the slanting sunbeams, but the old one disappeared into the relative darkness beyond that the light wind sounded full of corridors and storage containers and smelled of fresh cut wood. Fourteenth Trill darted after him and scuttled down the corridor clutching his sketch pad under one wing and attempting to arrange his undone satchel with the other.

By the time his eyes adjusted to the dimmer light of the building the old Winged, one Twenty-five Clicks if Fourteenth Trill remembered the name on the communication form correctly, had scuttled down through a slot in the floor that did not look like it would meet code regulations for a proper passage. Fourteenth Trill flicked his nostril frills in delight as he hopped down and onto a ledge, with no safety rail, that ran around a smaller human room. Meaning of course that it was massive and only slightly less intimidating than the alien forest outside. There were two windows that might have been the view ports on a space station for their size. They had been made up of dozens of standard sized windows set into a frame. The westward window was letting in the slanting golden sunlight and the alternating bars of brilliance and dimness reflected off of countless dust motes before coming to rest on a lumpy pile of something tossed on the floor. The pile was something like the discarded logs outside.

“The crew lead will brief you after he finishes his solar recharge,” the old Winged was saying.

Something in that statement was wrong enough to prod Fourteenth Trill to respond before the old Winged dissipated.

“Why would this base use solar powered tech this deep in a forest?” He asked. “You only get direct sun light for less than an hour in the afternoon.”

The old Winged tossed him a look that sounded of mild annoyance and more amusement.

“Not for the tech,” the old Winged said, jerking his head in the direction of the pile on the floor before hopping off the ledge and disappearing in a flutter of wings and a faint smell of medicated powder.

Fourteenth Trill stared at the pile on the floor curiously. He chirped and tilted his head to the side as he felt the return. Not logs he realized. They mass was far too soft and there was a Ranger Core standard solar shield tossed on one end of the mass in the golden light. Fourteenth Trill squinted at one corner of the pile that had just been relieved of the golden light by the movement of the sunbeam. With a sudden snort like a volcanic vent the pile shook itself, one massive hand appeared and came up to steady the solar shield as the pile, the human, it was a human Fourteenth Trill suddenly understood, the crew lead for the local Ranger Station, adjusted his mass so that he was centered in the sunbeam, gave two more mighty snorts, and then fell still.

Fourteenth Trill stared down in fascination. He needed to get settled into his place in the local wing. He needed to hydrate. He needed…

He pulled a hook cap out of his satchel and slipped it on. Below him the giant breathed quietly in the sunbeam.

So, here’s my question: as technologies develop and creatures begin traveling across the galaxy, does the acceptable size of political rule increase with the size of the explorable and livable universe and/or ease of travel? If not, does another factor effect it (such as ease of representation in multi-planet parties)?

As u guys have seen here . Im ok with literally anything .... Books ? Novels ? Anime ? Manga ? Korean Novels ? Chinese Novels ? Japanese Novels ? TV Shows/Movies ? Asian Shows/Movies ? 

Also One thing about my examples here are that none of them is only ""CLAIMED/STATED"" to be smart but did no smart stuff to be shown . They all have insane strategies and planning and logical reasoning and Quick thinking and Anticipating/predicting stuff and Manipulation/Deception skills and huge knowledge 

Also none of them r only smart academically or scientifically ( i dont mind if they are smart in that ways in fact its better that way but thats as long as they are smart in the stuff i mentioned above ) 


Everything is fine .

16p8id1,hot,Children of Time would make an incredible TV series,"On my third read through of CoT now, nearing the end, and I find myself constantly yearning for an 8-to-10 episode series to bring it to motion-picture life. I'm sure one of the two threads (pun intended) of the story would be very difficult to adapt, but if the show runners handled it with care, it would go gangbusters.

CoR could make a compelling blend of sci-fi and horror for a second season. Definitely similar difficulties on the table for adaption, but I see potential for a lot of fun being had with the new ""characters"" introduced there.

Children of Memory would be a hard one. For all the abstractions and reality bending happening, it would be an adaptation challenge for the ages. Might make a better mini-series or single film.

What do you all think? And who do you imagine playing your favorite characters? For Kern I imagine Maggie Smith of Professor McGonagall fame -- though she is perhaps too old for the role at this point. For Holsten, I picture a slightly less handsome Ewan McGregor, possibly?

16oim1y,hot,How to make humans look scary to tribal aliens?,"So I’m writing a story that involves a very ruined and generally degraded version of earth, a land of cold and darkness.

These aliens are tribal with a deep spiritual culture and strong belief in karma and are much taller than any human.

The aliens hear rumors that the planet they come from is cold, dark. The people live in cramped apartments and offices, staying up late into the night and preoccupied by fake images on their screens.

And the humans that are currently on their planet are strange. Diminutive and full of evil, gripped by an “insanity” that prompts them to consume and take endlessly. Or compels them to remain in states of tiredness and depression without end.

Such intelligent and technical wonders and yet, so little sight of things. To these aliens a humans body might be small and weak but their insanity is vast.

Maybe they underestimate them, tiny aliens the size of a child gripped by sadness and insanity. With fluffy hair and always wearing weird clothes, shirts that go down to their hips with strange writing and images on them. 

Their idea of demons tend to be vilified by the idea that they hate the great mother and nature. Which adds up with how humans in my setting act.

They’re also described to have the voice of many, which considering those tribes don’t know how human accents work, they might see the connection there.

You could even add in the fact most humans tend to lack the bright colors seen in the hair of most alien tribes which also adds up with the portrayal of demons.

But now the big question.

What do y’all think and what ideas can you give me? Any suggestions are welcome and appreciated",scifi,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16oim1y/how_to_make_humans_look_scary_to_tribal_aliens/,GuestOk583,2023-09-21 11:18:28,47,9,5.222222222222222,NA,NA,0

16of1eb,hot,Landscape with Invisible Hand,"This showed up on VOD a few weeks ago.  Kind of a sleeper Sci-Fi Movie.   Its not great, but its different.

Aliens introduce themselves to Earth, they look like a Walking Ottomans, and communicate by rubbing their forehands/paws together, like two pieces of sandpaper.  They provide new technology that helps humans, but this new tech ends up bankrupting many industries, leading to massive unemployment.  People have factory grown food, they have AR/VR education, but they dont have jobs and this leads to many being homeless. 

So after a few years, we see the aliens hiring humans as servants, nothing nefarious about it, humans jump at the chance at making 10x what they were making before.  So a highly skilled doctor of 20 years ends up being a chauffeur driving them around.  They live on floating landscapes that roam the surface.  They are respectful of the laws, but like some lawyers, know how to use the laws against people. 

Story revolves around a teenager who becomes smitten with another student at school, who is homeless.  He invites her (dad and brother) to live in his basement, naturally without telling the mom first.  Eventually money becomes an issue, so the young students decide to date while wearing some kind of AR/VR gadget on their head which records everything they do.  The aliens are fascinated with human emotions and pay people to wear these gadgets so they can experience love and relationships.  Some will call bullshit and claim the love isnt real and thats where the plot thickens, the teens get sued, leaving the mom (former lawyer) to offer an alternative that doesn't destroy their lives.

16ox3do,hot,How to ruin the world?,"So I’m planning and creating a science fiction project recently.

After some research and planning I’ve decided on a few major events that will get the world into a bad state.

Nuclear winters, carrington event and climate change.

Nearly all nations that haven’t been destroyed by climate disasters have seen a rise in authoritarianism, extremism and xenophobia. Support for human rights, minority groups and the plight of refugees is low. For a lot of North America and Europe the scapegoat is the Roma or immigrant from India.

The richer nations that have favorable geographies are the ones that managed to maintain a high standard of living by our standards.

The directorate of Canada, North American ring, Israel, coastal China, Greenland and Argentina (under occupation and demographic change)

Most days are rainy and grey, nights tend to be either pitch black or full of stars and northern or southern lights.

One can enjoy a frigid winters night complete with snow, ice and wind chill in Sydney or Perth. The directorate often sends humanitarian aid to alleviate the issues this caused for the Australian public, even despite this their population increases. 

In North America we have the Directorate of Canada, alongside its many puppet regimes and co-opted state governments in the former US. Having dominion over the strategically important and invaluable arctic oceans and Greenland they originally made their riches and wealth.

When the many disasters of the world came they were prepared, and even then it pushed them to their limit. Casual racism turned to race riots and acts of violence. Those who were seen as unable to contribute or just looked bad to the eyes of a armed official could be harmed, shot or have their stuff stolen and redistributed.

The UK, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand aren’t formally parts of the Directorate but do have ties and political connections. Scandinavia was invaded and regime change accomplished, them being very liberal was unacceptable.

Close ties to Japan and Korea formed from their cultural exchanges. The directorate is mostly accepting of women and the LGBT, although they don’t tolerate the scapegoats for the calamities of decades past. They harbor a hatred for Indian people in particular, with little care for many in the global south. After all women and LGBT are fine in their eyes as long as they tow the party line. ~~and aren’t “uncouth”~~

South Korea and Japan are ruled by a cutthroat coalition of chaebols. A chaebol is a large industrial conglomerates that are run and controlled by an owner or family. A chaebol aften consists of a large number of diversiled affiliates, controlled by a owner whose power over the group often exceeds and takes priority over legality.

Their money is made by their massive entertainment machines and factory infrastructure that runs off renewables and newly developed types of plastics. Anime and manga are important tools to keep other nations in line and friendly with them, due to its ease of creation with AI and cheap investment needed to get invaluable cultural influence and dominion. It’s not uncommon for them and the Directorate to cooperate.

Even in nations like these their citizens have been altered and warped by circumstances. The average person has picked their poison from callousness and eco fascism, depression and tiredness or guilt and apathy.

Global population has shrank from its high of 10 billion in 2029 to a paltry 2.3 billion in 2068. 

Democracy as we know it is dead.

The world is cold and dark, we are damned.

My end goal is to have a world that’s mostly populated by imperial cores and protectorates, exploited zones or dead areas. The richer parts of the world that have become more powerful include Canada, a lot of Eastern Europe and Russia, Patagonia and other cold places.

A world that’s mostly dark and cold, dystopian governments and nations supplied off plundered goods from neo colonial ventures, the majority of average citizens either depressed and tired or too xenophobic (mostly against Indians and Muslims) and callous to care. With these nations high command organizing the expeditions to a distant alien planet to take advantage of it too. 

Question is how to do that.

It is 2056, countries have become increasingly concerned with their own economic and political interests over the ongoing climate crisis. Nearly all nations that haven’t been destroyed by climate disasters have seen a rise in authoritarianism, extremism and xenophobia. Support for human rights, minority groups and the plight of refugees is low. Inequality has increased as power and money find themselves in the hands of a number of geopolitical blocs and multinational corporations that often prioritize their own interests and needs over the environment or less fortunate peoples. 

Wealthy nations have adopted heavily militarized borders. Drones, remote controlled machine guns and rockets on towers cyclone fences, 30 meter trenches filled with landmines, and more. 

As resources become more scarce in richer nations wars and skirmishes between countries become commonplace. Marginalized groups and peoples have become even more vulnerable and oppressed than before. Suspicion between nations and organizations has undermined efforts to develop a comprehensive plan or method of aiding those affected by climate change, leaving nations to deal with these problems on their own or simply let the victims perish.

Fleets and convoys made up of warships and illegal ships and aircraft are regularly sent to the land and waters of developing nations to be used for stealing and harvesting resources. This leaves even more innocent people either in poverty or with their lands and homes stolen by more powerful forces and given to those they deem worthy of owning it. 

Biodiversity has plummeted, all megafauna have gone extinct. Most crops are genetically engineered to produce as much food with as much nutrients as possible, factory farming and livestock breeding have become their most unethical forms. Giant abominations of flesh and milk are regularly slaughtered and harvested for consumption by the masses. 

A few major geopolitical blocs divide up what’s left of the world, they trade with each other and switch from fight to ally on a year by year basis.

In North America we have the Directorate of Canada, alongside its many puppet regimes and co-opted state governments in the former US. Having dominion over the strategically important and invaluable arctic oceans and Greenland they originally made their riches and wealth.

When the light came they were prepared, and even then it pushed them to their limit. Casual racism turned to race riots and acts of violence. Those who were seen as unable to contribute or just looked bad to the eyes of a armed official could be harmed, shot or have their stuff stolen and redistributed.

The UK, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand aren’t formally parts of the Directorate but do have ties and political connections. Scandinavia was invaded and regime change accomplished, them being very liberal was unacceptable.

They are somewhat capitalist, and often trade with many nations in the world. Close ties to Japan and Korea formed from their cultural exchanges. The directorate is mostly accepting of women and the LGBT, although they don’t tolerate the scapegoats for the calamities of decades past. They harbor a hatred for Indian people in particular, with little care for many in the global south. After all women and LGBT are fine in their eyes as long as they tow the party line. ~~and aren’t “uncouth”~~

South Korea and Japan are ruled by a cutthroat coalition of chaebols. chaebol is a large industrial conglomerates that are run and controlled by an owner or family. A chaebol aften consists of a large number of diversiled affiliates, controlled by a owner whose power over the group often exceeds and takes priority over legality.

Their money is made by their massive entertainment machines and factory infrastructure that runs off renewables and newly developed types of plastics. Anime and manga are important tools to keep other nations in line and friendly with them, it’s not uncommon for them and the Directorate to cooperate.

East Europe is controlled by a representative government made up of major groups in the Slavic world. Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic States are important members. Russia having been reconstructed after the fall of Putin remains kept in check by the other members as counterweights.

Many areas of the globe are in ruin, India and Pakistan are desolate due to relentless flooding, heatwaves, demographic collapse and nuclear fallout. Other areas of Asia are radio silent and haven’t been contacted ever since. 

The world is cold and dark, Australias coast has become similar to taiga in temperatures. One can enjoy a frigid winters night complete with snow, ice and northern lights in Sydney or Perth. The directorate often sends humanitarian aid to alleviate the issues this caused for the Australian public, even despite this their population increases.

16nsaah,hot,Thoughts on my stories vision of the future?,"Hello all, I am writing a story that has dystopian roots and takes place in the very near future during what I call the modern dark age or global dark age.

This follows after a small number of unnamed crises, the great Indian trial and the more severe consequences of climate change mainly.

India as a nation suffered from climate change and heatwaves. It was a very slow decline starting with an outbreak of rabies in Mumbai harming a lot of the surrounding area and disrupting Bollywood and important Indian cultural sites, this also killed many celebrities and movie stars.

When times got tougher in other countries they started to blame Indians and made them to be scapegoats, how they deserved to be deported and have their stuff taken away because they burnt dirty energy and sucked money from the economy. As radical groups and politics grew, they soon acted on these promises.

The end came when nuclear war between Pakistan and India broke out, causing a localized nuclear winter. The hardest hit areas were the Philippines and Malay archipelago. Australia was cold and dark, the Philippines was repurposed into a meat grinder for many nations around the globe to recruit soldiers from. Australia was made an important jumping point to Antartica and the quick shipping routes over the arctic sea.

Meanwhile in North America a new superpower was emerging, the Directorate of Canada. A nation mostly ignored for most of the world’s history was made massively rich due to melting arctic frontiers and dominance over many arctic trade routes and shipping lanes all throughout the oceans. 

The amount of American refugees and migrants combined with temporary workers had reached a critical mass, liberal governments and politics didn’t work for them. The directorate promised an end to Indian immigration and the people supposedly stealing their jobs. They promised the land and money the undesirables had would be redistributed and used to help their parties base.

South Korea soon fell to the influence of chaebols and mega corporations that were more interested in trade and investment into the emerging directorate. Japan was also subsumed soon after by the anime, tech and other industries there. 

East Europe was busy getting their things together, Poland growing powerful enough to mobilize lots of Eastern Europe and the post soviet states to hold off Russia and eventually neutralize them after their collapse when Putin died.

As resources become more scarce in richer nations wars and skirmishes between countries become commonplace. Marginalized groups and peoples have become even more vulnerable and oppressed than before. Suspicion between nations and organizations has undermined efforts to develop a comprehensive plan or method of aiding those affected by climate change, leaving nations to deal with these problems on their own or simply let the victims perish.

Wealthy nations have adopted heavily militarized borders. Drones, remote controlled machine guns and rockets on towers cyclone fences, 30 m trenches filled with landmines, and more. All of this is to keep the climate refugees out and ensure those that can’t be used or integrated into the system perish.

It’s these geopolitical blocs and multinational corporations that control what’s left of the world. Neo colonialist governments and practices are the norm, and covered up completely by governments and corporations. The majority of people are tired, xenophobic and callous. Democracy and human rights are dead, the globe has fallen into a second dark age.

The moon is pretty massive compared to the earth, so much that we're kinda a binary system. If its gravitational pull on the oceans creates tides, wouldn't it also pull on the crust and mantle, potentially creating tides of magma underneath and unseen?

Could this be a reason the earth has remained tectonic longer than other planets like Venus and Mars? How much of this could be related to the magnetosphere?

Is there a more efficient path or is this as good as it gets? Does he not have some obscure hidden collection that compiles all the short stories and novellas or is my only option to scour the land for his collections, contrasting against Wikipedia articles like a scribe doing historical research?

And I am seriously miffed at whatever happened to this film in the editing room.

This film could be cut into a hundred different scenes and by themselves they are perfect. The director's vision is on the screen, the emotionals scenes are in, the wonder is there, the mystery is ther.

But when you watch those scenes in sequence, the film kind of breaks down. It overexplains itself, has basically three separate beginnings, rushes to show off the martian scenes, as if afraid that the audience mistakingly believe they are watching a Western or something.

It is PAINFULL to watch the film rush to explain itself with poorly-fitted scenes at the start, and then explain itself much more organically in its runtime proper. Remined me of the theatrical version of Dark City.

I wish we got a Director's cut for John Carter of Mars too.

So I’m toying around with this possible faction for a story project I’m working on. The way it works is that human can upload their consciousness into a neural network to achieve a form of immortality. 

The inside of the neural network is set up kind of like a matrix or Virtual reality. Designed to be a virtually simulated plain of existence for those in the neural network. 

If one wished to they could upload their consciousness into a robotic android or bioengineered enhanced human body. The main copy of their consciousness remains in the neural network so if this body is killed or destroyed they could upload into a new body if they wished.

16mh58e,hot,"[Spoilers, I guess?] AM from IHNMaIMS is always cast with the voice of a grown man. He should have a child's voice.","Mam that's an acronym. Has anyone come up with a better one for I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream? This sort story/game is literally famous for it's ending but like, just in case anyone feels cheated that I reveal the main character ends up with no Mouth to do his screaming with. 

I know Ellison loved to dunk on people who liked to interpret his work or make assertions of his intent, but. I'll hazard a guess that this was probably part of his original vision sort of based on interviews he had about this story. 

Chris Pratt is going to play AM in the remake they're making of the game. Ellison himself actually played AM in the original, which is very fitting. The game changes a lot from the source material, I'm not trying to imply casting AM as a adult man is wrong. 

However, if anyone was going to try to make an adaptation of IHNMaIMS a bit closer to the source material, an easier way to get across some of the subtext that was in Ellison's original story to translate to an audio visual medium would be to cast AM as a child. Part of the grand sin that the 5 survivors are being punished for, part of why AM hates humanity, is because humanity created a being that's caught in a terrible limbo between god and human. The ability to do anything but create, infinite potential but no means to self actualize, knowledge and power with no purpose. The title refers to Ted's fate most literally, but it's also a metaphorical description of AM's aswell. 

Both the humanity itself and AM are simultaneously victim and abuser. Both are despicable and tragic. But of course, as humans are the one's reading/playing/maybe someday watching the story, I think most people are much more naturally inclined to empathize with the survivors. The narrative is most impactful and even more horrific when AM is framed in a way that challenges the audience to empathize with him too. 

The original short story only describes the cruelty humanity subjected AM to, where as it actively shows AM's cruelty to the survivors. Of course that's because it's from Ted's perspective, but. Even so, reading the story for the first time after playing the game, I was struck with how profoundly childish AM is. He's doing the things he's doing out of spite for sure, but distinctly his kinds of punishments are less methodical plans to create the most suffering possible. They're very much in the same line of logic of a child actively annoying their parents because they're bored and want attention. Just, in this case it's an all powerful super computer in his terrible 2s. When he pits the survivors up against a big monster and arms them with sticks (or bows and arrows?) to fight it, and they're just so numb to it all they don't do what he wanted. That he makes them do what they do to Ellen because he thinks it's funny. Those kinds of interactions.

In the conclusion, it's somewhat implied that AM stops really torturing Ted other than altering his ability to conceptualize the passage of time. Even then that might not have been intended as a punishment, and you think he would have done that immediately if he was really looking for the most efficient way to torment the survivors from the beginning. It seems more so like he's scrambled to haphazardly alter Ted in any way he could to make sure he couldn't ""leave"" him by dying. AM doesn't want to be alone, and can't interact normally with the only other sentient creatures he knows of other than trolling them into madness. AM was already suffering the fate Ted is left with at the end from his birth. He's humanity's collective progeny and we were terrible parents. 

All of this subtext would be much easier to communicate through implication alone if he had a child's voice. That he's more a bratty immature Hal 9000 than a hyper competent malevolent Skynet.",scifi,0.42,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16mh58e/spoilers_i_guess_am_from_ihnmaims_is_always_cast/,ThisDudeisNotWell,2023-09-19 00:18:55,115,22,5.2272727272727275,NA,NA,0

16l77nr,hot,The Big Book of Science Fiction Read - Story 2 - Sultana's Dream by Rokheya Shekhawat Hossain,"The introduction to this anthology champions the cause of the *conte philosophique* – or fable of reason. It is the Vandermeers’ opinion that science fiction is also the realm of philosophy , the capacity to encase the kernel of a philosophical idea within a story and deploy it into the consciousness of the wider world. Is this a warranted expansion of the boundaries of the genre? Are there even any clearly defined boundaries to science fiction or does it exist merely in the mind of the reader, anthologist or the author of the piece?

Sultana’s Dream is the first of these “fables of reason” that The Vandermeer’s propose as part of a definitive anthology of science fiction through the ages. This anthology is arranged in chronological order and this particular story was published in 1905 and chronicles, through a narrative dream Begum Rokheya’s own hopes for women in India. 

Sultana falls asleep and dreams of herself in a world called “Ladyland” where gender roles are reversed. The men are forced to be docile , within the zenana while the women are free – to pursue their interests and make the world a better place. Sultana is in awe of Ladyland, its beauty, its natural wonders and its endless capacity for scientific innovation. We are treated to a view of Ladyland , at a distance like tourists and then, abruptly Sultana wakes up. 

The dream of course refers to the dream Sultana has but is also the dream that Begum Rokheya hopes for with regard to Indian women , especially Muslim women. There is no effort to impart tension to the proceedings, no characters stand out or have any major interactions with each other, there is no attempt at realism – everything is laid bare and served to the audience directly – this is not a story but an attempt to educate and rouse the general public, increase their awareness of a particular problem and encourage them to take action.

Does this really work? I think as a message to the general public it is incredibly effective. It doesnt hide behind metaphor or flowery prose. It is direct and a story that you cannot look away from. I think Begum Rokheya knew what she was doing when she wrote this and did an incredibly effective job of it. 

Did I like it ? No. I am more susceptible to character, nuance, metaphors and the tools of storytelling and anything that lacks these leaves me incredibly cold. This story is also dated in its language and its telling, in its basic form with very little in this story that I liked. Agreeing with the message does not lessen my yearning for a better delivery. 

Is this story science fiction? There is a dream of an alternate reality but it is very firmly stated to be a dream. There are mentions of scientific innovations that make life better but there isn’t that slim thread of plausibility that makes for engaging reading in science fiction – the plausibility that makes The Time Machine and The Invisible Man, even The Island of Doctor Moreau seem so prescient and terrifying. Sultana’s dream can be considered as science fiction yes but it operates one the blurred borders, like a celestial object  that is nearing escape velocity. ",scifi,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16l77nr/the_big_book_of_science_fiction_read_story_2/,pranavroh,2023-09-17 13:50:08,93,17,5.470588235294118,NA,NA,0

# Humans are Weird – Alterations

Original Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-alteration](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-alteration)

“Second Grandfather!” First Daughter called out, scampering up to him, her frill twitching in indignation. “Second Cousin Betty is late!”

First Daughter tilted her head sideways to get a better look at Second Grandfather and felt her antenna curl in annoyance. He was still carefully weaving the dried vine leaves into something, probably a work basket. While he had tilted one of his wide, gleaming eyes down at her he was clearly not giving her proper attention.

“Human Second Cousin Betty said she would meet me by the grandmother vine when the sunspot touched the pool!” First Daughter explained slowly and carefully, just in case Second Grandfather had missed the implications.

“Well has it touched the pool yet?” Second Grandfather asked absently, reaching out with a hind foot to stroke her leg in a soothing gesture that one used on hatchlings.

First Daughter pulled her leg in with a very dignified and affronted click.

“The sunspot is an antenna’s curl past the pool!” She informed him, laying her antenna down flat against her head to emphasize the indignity of having to wait such a long time.

“Well why don’t you go over and see what is keeping her?” Second Grandfather asked.

First Daughter rocked back on her hindmost legs in exasperation.

“Second Sister is busy in the north vineyards,” she explained, the tone of her voice simply oozing patience, “Second Grandmother is helping her. All the aunts are cleaning seed or raking under the hanging lines. First Father and Second Father are running around the lines like midges-”

“Watch your language!” Second Grandfather gave her a scolding tap with his hind leg and First Daughter clicked her mandibles in annoyance.

“They are!” She insisted.

“Well how does all that keep you from going to find out why Second Cousin Betty is late?” Second Grandfather asked.

First Daughter stared up at him with clear exasperation in the prim set of her frill.

“I can’t go over to the human hive by myself,” she informed him in a slow patient tone.

“Of course not,” Second Grandfather said, suppressed amusement making his mandibles click slightly. “You will take Second Daughter with you.”

“But there is no aunt or father to go with us!” First Daughter insisted, stamping her back feet in annoyance.

“Then go like sisters yourself,” Second Grandfather said simply.

First Daughter froze and looked at him aghast, her broad head slowly rotating from side to side.

“Why not?” Second Grandfather demanded. “You are more than old enough to be First Sister. Your antennas peeked over the boundary hedges weeks ago! Go hook a sister and trot on over to the human hive.”

“I,” she hesitated, “I don’t think I want to be First Sister just yet,” she finally said, but she backed up and started towards the main garden thoughtfully with Second Grandfather clicking in amusement behind her.

Second Daughter was playing in the litter under the sweet fruit vines and came along quickly enough when First Daughter asked her too. They followed the main path to where the canopy grew high and thin like the humans liked it, and they went through the gate of the fence into the orchards of the human hive. First Daughter had to wrestle with the latch a bit but she got it open and made sure to close it securely behind them. One of the humans tending the trees waved at them but didn’t stop them to talk and First Daughter boldly led Second Daughter up to the squat wooden structure that she knew Second Cousin slept in.

“Hello!” she called out to Human First Mother. “We are here because Second Cousin Betty is late!”

“I think she’s still in her room,” Human First Mother said indicating the door with a wave of a spoon before turning back to her work.

First Daughter scampered to the door and gave a few polite scratches before opening it and bounding eagerly in.

“Second Cousin Betty!” she called out, frill flushing eagerly. “Why are you late? I asked Second Grandfather to come with me to ask you and he said I could come with just a sister because we will soon be sisters….Second Cousin Betty….”

First Daughter paused over the flat bed that humans were so fond of and tilted her head curiously to the side. Second Cousin Betty was clearly in the bed. The shape of her was obvious under the quilt, but Second Cousin Betty wasn’t moving, and the only sound that she made was suspiciously similar to the distress noises she had made when her favorite fruit tree had died. Feeling a sudden flush of unease First Daughter reached out and tried to pull the quilt away from Second Cousin Betty’s head.

“Come out of there and talk to me!” First Daughter insisted. “You had better not be hiding an injury! Humans do that but its stupid!”

A noise of protest came from the human shaped lump and the quilt tightened around the form.

“I didn’t even cut myself!” Second Cousin Betty’s voice came muffled from under the quilt.

First Daughter’s antenna curled in unease.

“I didn’t say anything about cuts,” she observed. “What about cuts?”

“Nothing about cutting!” Second Cousin Betty shrieked. “It’ll grow back!”

“What will grow back?” First Daughter demanded, pulling harder at the quilt. “What did you cut?”

“Go away!” Second Cousin Betty howled. “You got...you, your legs are too long!”

Second Daughtergave a horrified snap of her mandibles and her frill flushed. First Daughter felt her own frill stiffen and flush with annoyance.

“Come out from under that quilt or I will summon Human First Mother,” she said sternly.

Second Cousin Betty gave a wail of frustration but slowly wriggled out from under the insulating layer. Second Daughter’s frill went waxy and white and she grabbed First Daughter’s legs to stay upright. First Daughter stared in fascinated horror at Second Cousin Betty’s face. The human’s flesh was puffy and discolored, but that wasn’t the problem. Both of them had seen what happened after Second Cousin Betty cried before. It was disgusting, and distrubing but normal for a human. No, what had shocked them both was the suddenly lack of hair. A solid two fingers’ width of the fibrous mass had clearly been cut off, from the edge of the mass and from ear to ear.

“What did you do?” First Daughter demanded.

“I wanted a bang,” Second Cousin Betty said with a sniff, as she tried to stop the loss of fluids. “It was hard.”

First Daughter took a deep breath and turned around to mind her younger sister.

“Second Cousin Betty isn’t hurt,” she told the trembling one firmly. “She just did something…”  First Daughter rather wanted to say stupid, but the human was clearly in enough distress as it was. “She did something silly.”

Second Daughter did not look convinced.

“Second Cousin Betty,” First Daughter said, tilting her head back around. “Would you let Second Daughter touch your hair, so she can know you aren’t hurt?”

Second Cousin Betty seemed to perk up at this idea and patted the bed beside her. Probably soothed as much by the human calming down as by the words Second Daughter scrambled up on the bed and let Second Cousin Betty put her fingers on the stubby fibers left in her scalp. Meanwhile First Daughter slipped out of the room to speak to Human First Mother. If she was going to have to start dealing with cousins randomly cutting off extraneous parts of their bodies she might as well be First Sister now as Second Grandfather had said.

Also featured a guy with a cool haircut, receded temples but a long fringe to the side.

Along the way he helps societies of lizard people and grows and matures while his guard tries to advise/help him across four books.,"Edit: Found! March Upcountry by David Weber and John Ringo.

&#x200B;

It begins with an assassination attempt and a young prince traveling on a spaceship. During the attempt the assassins damage the ship forcing the Guard who protects the young prince to evacuate to a nearby planet before the ship explodes. There is one outpost a great deal of distance away from where they crash/landed. The young prince is of course pompous and self serving and childish. Forcing one of the Guard commanders to be rather rough in his tone and words in breaking reality to the young prince that they are set up for months of tramping through a jungle.

Eventually they come upon a lizard person species that while primitive are intelligent enough to have language and community. They decide to help the lizard people. Hence the four total books continue with the party traveling. Coming acrostic other civilizations of mostly lizard people. Brokering treaties. Picking sides. Waging wars for one side or the other.

And all in all the young prince grows and matures more throughout the journey of the four total books. He has to make hard decisions and deal with the consequences.Eventually in the last book they get to the outpost and steal a ship. Only to find out a coup has happened. And with the young princes now many months of hard journeying and experience has him planning how to undo the coup. Which is advantageous because he is believed dead.

Like mentioned i'm looking for a story that progresses similar to this:

1. Humans were alone in the galaxy after thousands of years humanity are essentially gods (e.g. forerunner from halo, elders from exforce).
2. Something happens idk for example virus, disaster, civil war, we get bored ... and almost all humans die or disappear.
3. Long long after, the lack of humans, allows for many alien races to evolve in the galaxy.
4. Aliens, find some lost human tech start to reverse engineer and become a technological advanced oppressive empire.
5. Some aliens find a human ship where crew are in stasis, and wake them up.
6. One of the people woken up is an admiral or general and is disappointed about the state of galaxy, slavery is rampant, planets and their population are exploited by the new empire core worlds ....
7. Humans chose to help...
8. Hell ensues... For the empire ...

Maybe he’s living in his parents house playing a hyper realistic sim just like this to feel like he has a sense of power. Just like in a Sims game he can decide whether you eat, sleep, are successful handsome what have you. Maybe he gets gratification from people worshiping him because his crappy life IRL so he blesses those people with great lives while ruining other people.

As the title suggests . Im a sucker for those stories that has 1 or even better if there is 2 or more characters who got huge brains inside their head ....

Y'know the super intelligent/genius characters with godly ( calculative abilities and logical reasoning + analysis ) ?

Or the super cunning/manipulative/scheming characters who are ( master Strategists/tacticians/planners/schemers ) ? 

I dont mind either . The character can be a genius who doesn't have absurd ( Emotional intelligence ) and/or ( social intelligence )
But makes up for it with superhuman intelligence and logical reasoning and risk assessment and analysis etc ... 

Or basically the opposite . Or even a perfect character who have them all .... doesn't matter really 


But i hate characters who are labeled as ""Genius Once In A Million Years . Cunning As An Ancient Wise Devil"" but is so dense that even my little sister could do better judgement and decisions than hum ...

And i also hate characters who are only smart at inventing machines/magic formulas or only good at academics/science only without applying it to outsmart enemies

16irm71,new,"Any Sci Fi that glorifies ""humanity going soft""?","The closest I can think of is Star Wars and even then it seems like it is done in a way in which the ""soft"" species tend to suffer greatly like the Caamasi and Star Wars isn't supposed to be based off of ""real humans"". I guess Star Trek also is a Sci Fi universe based on the ""real world"" that doesn't preach ""hardness"" as the only way to battle stagnation and decay. (I also realize writing this that I just listed two of the biggest Sci Fi franchises.)

But it seems like every other Sci Fi novel/movie/etc., pushes the notion that being content is bad, struggle is good, and basically the ""pain is weakness leaving the body"" slogan on every high school sports team team t-shirt but at a species wide level. Even as something as silly as Wall E from a company like Disney, seems to worry about a future where humans are lazy, greedy, and degenerate. (Okay so this post is based on a shower though after reading Dune and watching Walle E). Some to take to an extreme like Warhammer40K but almost all have this trope to some form.

I know this comes from a real world fear of decadence and degeneration that seems to be almost univeral across all cultures. From a sociological persepective, it's interesting that we as a species seem to have this top of mind, even though most people in the developed world could just watch TV and eat takeout if they really wanted to but instead do things like climb mountains and run marathons. But I was wondering if there were Sci Fi movies which glorified peace, contentness, tranquility, harmony instead of toughness, challenge, friction, war. That challenges the notion that being content, enjoying life, pleasure, and peace have to be bad and proposes that they can be good?

Edit: Thanks everyone I'll check out alot of the suggestions! It sounds like the Culture, Star Trek (Especially Next Generation), the Postman, Bablyon 5, and the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy are the main ones. But also lots of interesting stories for me to check, appreciate everyone sending them.

For reference, because I don't think I was clear - the top three examples that I could look up that fit the best (imo) what I was looking for were the Postman (because I have read/seen it and just totally forgot, but I feel like in alot of Sci Fi the Holnists could have easily been portrayed as the good guys (if they weren't so extreme) and why society carried on after it collapsed due ot decadence), the Star Trek Episode ""let He Without Sin"", and the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy quote about civilizations divided by the lunch question.",scifi,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16irm71/any_sci_fi_that_glorifies_humanity_going_soft/,EricClawson48017,2023-09-14 15:34:59,48,8,6.0,NA,NA,0

Another vague one is a guy in the frozen wilderness… he spits and the spit freezes before it hits the ground.  Then he gets to a cabin but he can barely light a fire because his fingers are just too cold.

16hzfyn,new,"Yet another ""what is the title of this short story I vaguely remember?""","You know the deal. I'm trying to reread something I read as a kid, and I don't remember the title. It's a short story or a novella.

An alien probe is discovered one day in the midwest. It just sits there, with a forcefield around it. Any attempts to communicate with it or breach the forcefield is ignored. The chapter based time-skips all run like ""Probability of occurrence, 0.1% There is nothing here yet"".

Basically, the probe is waiting for an AI to emerge, and then it offers the new AI a way off the planet. It waits for hundreds of years, through a global population die-off of humans due to microplastic pollution interfering with reproduction, a nanotech accident, and the eventual rise of the first AI.

Probably from the 90's or early 2000's.

16h0tv2,new,FTL systems that have inconsistent travel speed due to acknowledged in-universe factors actually make sense and could even enhance the story and lore.,"So, in my experience in some sci-fi communities, in this case, *Halo*, some people really dislike how the FTL can be quite inconsistent, such as the travel time being different between books and chapters even though the distance was supposed to be the same or similar.

Obviously, this happens because the books are written by various authors, and sometimes the same authors forget the figures they just wrote; however, I think this wasn't a flaw in writing. Sometimes, the contradictions make more sense than everything being perfectly on point.

* So in *Halo,* there are two known factors that constantly affect the efficiency of interstellar transit: **The nature of Slipspace** and **The frequency of FTL being used**.

For the first point. Slipstream space is an alternate spacetime consisting of eleven non-visible infinitesimal dimensions. Slipspace has vastly different physical laws, and the distance between objects **in real space** doesn't translate to distance in Slipspace.

>Query: Does the de facto location of the star system known as Epsilon Indi coincide with 21st-century human observations of said system? I ask this because there is a discrepancy between the apparent distance to said system (Harvest being humanity's most distant colony) and early observational evidence of the system being only 11 light-years from Earth and thus only half a light-year further than one of the closest colonies, Reach.  
>  
>Query Answer: \[slip stream space\] transit records record liminal \[sphere\] colony \[ref: Harvest\] as furthest official Human colony. \[slip stream space\] topology is not consistent with \[Euclidean\] distance, but significant discrepancy is noted.  
>  
>(*Halo, Waypoint, Catalog Interaction, 2969317*)

Even if your destination is close to you on paper/~~real space~~, the fact that you choose to go to another dimension as a passage means you have to forgo your understanding of the common physical laws. It adds to the exotic and mysterious nature of Halo's ftl.

The second one was introduced more recently in *The Forerunner trilogy* and expanded upon in later sources.

Basically, using Slipspace actually hurt the space-time continuum; this makes sense since you're literally tearing a hole in reality. In the lore, doing so would have an aftereffect that interferes with other FTL activities.

>***Reconciliation Debt:***  
>  
>All faster-than-light movement and communication create a dangerous ""Reconciliation Debt"" of causality violations both in the ship and the surrounding space-time. The resulting hyperspatial strain interferes with interstellar travel and communication over a wide area until the effect dissipates.  
>  
>(*Halo, Encyclopedia 2022, p.339*)

It was said in *Halo: Warfleet* that severe degrees of Reconciliation debt have severe consequences, ranging from travel across large areas being slowed down or crippled to ships getting torn apart because reality was fucked over.

The reason why Reconciliation Debt didn't appear in older books made sense, since those books were centered in the modern era, where FTL activities were relatively infrequent. The more ships using FTL, the worse Reconciliation could get.

On the other hand, the time period *The Forerunner trilogy* centered in was a way different story. Unlike humanity and the Covenant, the Forerunners didn't use Slipspace just for travel and communications but *various other reality-bending applications (*[***Too long to be added here, so a separate post for those interested***](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloStory/comments/11tvfhs/slipspace_debt_why_maintaining_a_galaxyspanning/)*).* The frequency, scale, and intensity of those activities were so great that Forerunners had to establish a government department regulating Slipspace.

This reason for inconsistency also played a significant part in the story of the Forerunner trilogy, adding suspense to the plot by making the characters' fate unpredictable.

In the stories, the Forerunners were at a losing war with an apocalyptic force hellbent on consuming all life in the galaxy. FTL travel became a priceless ""resource"" that had to be carefully managed. Minor military operations and civilian activities had to be cut short, and a miscalculated jump would not only endanger the ship's crew, it also mean other ships had to wait for the debt to be dissipated for their next turn. The characters' survival was heavily tied to the stability of the FTL system.",scifi,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/16h0tv2/ftl_systems_that_have_inconsistent_travel_speed/,leonreddit8888,2023-09-12 15:39:31,150,23,6.521739130434782,NA,NA,0

16gv4v7,new,Fairly well-known work of science fiction dealing with exopolitics in modern day Earth?,"Come to think of it, this kind of subject is really difficult to pull off any positive or uplifting stories. 

So the Earth is a kind of political hotspot in the Orion Arm as of 2023 and too many different civilizations are eyeing on in because of its strategic values. And there's really not much we can do. Yes, this is a fairly bleak setting already. But it's based on real history on Earth. It's based on the history of my home country.

They say Korean peninsular is probably the worst geopolitical location. Not much natural resource but it's an important location for international politics. And it has been surrounded by hostile neighbors for many centuries. In the 19th century when western colonialism was in the full gear, many empires eyed on Joseon Dynasty Korea, which had maintained isolationist policy for many centuries. And my family was actually fairly well related to some major political events in the turn of the century.

Empress Myeongsong, the ambitious and amoral consort of the puppet emperor of Korea, colluded with Russiasn (heh) to sell off the kingdom to them. Rivalling Imperial Japan that has been eyeing on Korea for centuries wouldn't tolerate it. Eventuallly they send an army of thugs to storm the royal palace and assassinate the Empress and her servants.

My great-great grandfather was an artisan offering Kimchi to the palace. He was actually summoned by the royal court to live near the palace, from his humble hometown far from the capital of Seoul. He must have been a very good artisan and also a very sociable man. His neighbor was a concubine who was banished from the palace by the jealous empress. Born from a lower class humble street vendor, the concubine quickly befirended my great great grandfather. Then the assassination happened.

The concubine became the next empress/queen and my family could accumulate sizable wealth and lands near the palace. Then, after the Japanese occupation happened we lost it all. I was told that we lost everything because of we co-signed a bad loan, but later I learned that that was how Japanese conquerors stole wealth from many established families.

But, ironically losing all the wealth eventually saved my family. During the Korean War, NK troops slaughtered all land owners who couldn't escape on time. Yeah, so...my family was spared.

And back to Japanese occupation, my great grandmother worked as a housemaid for a family of Japanese nobleman who treated her with dignity and kindness. She always ate with them. 

Considering this sort of family history, it's really difficult to think of some uplifting story of resistance during the alien invasion/occupation.

7y1l9f,top,Altered Carbon is great.,"I've seen a lot of negative and mixed press so I thought I would give my 2 cents. I am a big fan of the books and was very wary when I saw the original trailer however I am pleased to say I really enjoyed the whole series.
It wasn't without it's faults and there were a couple of times that I was confused by aspects of the plot but those are massively outweighed by a stellar performance from nearly the whole cast (especially those in 'cross-sleeve' performances) and fantastic world building.


Overall I'd say it was definitely worth your time.

75q4fv,top,"Blade Runner 2049 neither dodges the shadow of its predecessor nor attempts to recreate it, instead bravely introducing new ideas and themes","'Continuation' is the word that comes to mind with 2049. I didn't get the sense that it was trying to recreate the original film (*cough cough The Force Awakens) or completely detach itself, like Prometheus. It acted as a perfect continuation of the original film, building on the original themes such as being, slavery, and humanity, and introducing some new ones, the most interesting of which was procreation. 

It would have been easy for the film to get sucked into the past with Deckard's life after BR, but the movie remembers that Ryan Gosling' K is the heart of the film, and it's his inner conflict and ultimate conclusive ark that is the heart of the film. This for me is was the essence of the first Blade Runner, past the flying cars, neon lights and funky music.  For that (and a lot of other stuff), I think the movie was a success.

rnl63u,top,Arrival (2016 by Dennis Villeneuve) gave the most realistic depiction of an Alien invasion of Earth.,"(SPOILERS)
When 12 ships arrive on earth their intentions are unclear.

However unlike many other Alien Invasion movies, these limbed figures do not come with giant explosives and lasers.

They come here with a language, their language.

Across the length of the movie, Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner enter the ships and attempt to communicate with the heptapods. Every day they learn more about the aliens’ language.

Eventually we come to learn that the alien species’ language can unlock the process of non-linear thinking. Time is non-linear and we have essentially lived our lives already. They can access the past, present, and future.

They came to Earth to teach us a language, in return they require our assistance in 3000 years.

What is rare for an alien movie is that there is almost no Earth-chauvinism in the design. These are not bipedal mammals with prosthetic foreheads, or big eyes.

They’re just — alien, and almost completely inscrutable.

If Aliens wanted to destroy us, they would send an asteroid our way or blast us from billions of miles away. But they didn’t.

They came here with a message, they came here with an unseen advanced language and what an alien would probably look like.

They came in peace.

If a more intelligent species came to our Earth they certainly would not be looking for extermination.

Yes, I’m looking at you Independence Day.",scifi,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/rnl63u/arrival_2016_by_dennis_villeneuve_gave_the_most/,ponypo_Guilty_Sea346,2021-12-24 07:16:03,100,16,6.25,NA,NA,0

7m47qm,top,The problem with Star Wars is not that it violates real world physics. Rather it breaks its own rules.,"For example- 

Space bombs aren't stupid because gravity doesn't exist in space. Space bombs are stupid because propulsion warheads (aka missiles/torpedos etc.) are a thing. (Especially when it is established later that hyperspace can be weaponised. Hello! Hyperspace cruise missiles? After all a hyperdrive can fit on a starfighter)

Arcing long range artillery shots in space aren't stupid because there isn't gravity in space. Artillery shots in space are stupid because up until now, it hasn't worked that way. Ever.

Poe Dameron doing a flip-and-burn maneouver is actually more in line with how real space fighter combat might work. However up until now it has been established that space fighter combat in the Star Wars universe works like fighter combat in World War 2.

EDIT- Just thought of another thing. Why don't some of Snoke's support ships hyperspace out and then back in again but this time AHEAD of the escaping resistance fleet to cut them off? Is there an explanation for that? After all the Imperial fleet hid behind Endor and then hyperspaced out and back in to cut off the rebel assault during the battle of Endor.

v3xj55,top,Raised by Wolves is one of the best sci-fi series out there (imo) and is getting cancelled by Warner after the acquisition. The actors ask for your help.,"I don’t know if this is the right sub to post this, but personally it was one of the best sci-fi show I watched in recent years. Such a beautiful series cannot end like this, Raised by Wolves already has a complete written story, and was received really well both by Critics and Public. Right now, many HBO series are not getting renewed after the acquisition, and it looks like Raised by Wolves is one of them. But unlike all the others, nothing has been said about this one yet, because there is still hope to find a new home/publisher for the series, thanks to many different reasons (a great reception, a fully written story, a big production behind, a passionate community etc).  

The Actor that plays “Father” in the show, Abubakar Salim, recently posted on the main sub for the show (r/raisedbywolves) asking for the help of the fans. ScottFree and everyone else involved in the series are currently looking for a new home like Netflix, Amazon, Apple etc. Using #RenewRaisedByWolves on Twitter, discussing with fans online, with every interested youtubers, even just talking about it online, making your voice heard, anything could help them finding a new home for the show.   

For anyone interested, here’s the original post [ https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbywolves/comments/v3thpg/call_of_action/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf ]  

It would be such a shame to lose a series so beautiful and interesting, full of mysteries and secrets that are yet to be discovered. I don’t know how much a post like this can do but I haven’t seen anyone talking about this and seriously, any help is appreciated. Thanks for the attention and sorry for my English. There is hope for this series, but the voice of the public is really the most important thing for them right now. Let’s hope for the best (and Praise Sol obliviously...). Also I mean, we can’t let them cancel the most powerful T-Pose in television lol

I had thought it was just going to be another CBS show. 

Now when I look for info about the show, I keep seeing things about the ""All Access"" app. 

Am I alone here? I've only heard good things about the show itself, but it seems obvious to me that it is doomed if people can only see it on the app.

I already have Playstation Vue, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and VRV. I'm not about to subscribe to another app.

And it makes me want to skip the premiere altogether. 

I'm old and maybe I'm just the last to know, but I doubt I'll be watching this one. 

Edit: Obligatory R.I.P. inbox

Everybody has strong opinions on all this; I do too. I've avoided hearing too much about the show because I'm the sort that doesn't like spoilers and I like to see things and form my own opinions. This time that means I missed out on learning about this streaming service and its exclusivity. I am in the US so my only legit option to see this show (for now) is the service. 

I'm old. I can afford to pay for it, but I won't. It's because I won't be supporting Star Trek, I will be supporting CBS's app *that still forces you to watch commercials unless you pay for the higher tier.*

There is no place to put an asterix next to my payment that says ""Dear CBS executives- this money is just for Star Trek."" There is no way I can send my money directly to a post office that directly supports the show or the people behind it. And now that I've learned more about how Netflix paid for the production of season 1, I feel like I have already paid into this new show already. 

And I know I can torrent it. I'd rather wait for the chance to pay for a legit BluRay or VOD where I know my money ticks the right box. 

If I give CBS my money for this, I won't be sending the message that I'm supporting Star Trek, I'm telling CBS  I am interested in paying for a service that provides on-demand viewing of ""Big Bang Theory"" and ""Two Broke Girls"" back catalogs. Sure, I'll miss out (for now) but I already subscribe to streaming services that provide more content than I can view in a single lifetime. I don't want or need to pay for another to see a single unproven show.

fufppn,top,[DUNE] As a fan of Dune I am grateful J.J. Abrams is not directing the new Dune adaptation,"The trinity would've been completed, had he gotten his hands on Star Trek, Star Wars *and* Dune - arguably the three greatest sagas in Spacefaring Epics.

The man is creatively bankrupt. The Rise Of Skywalker was still being written and re-written 3 months after release - hell if I know, they're probably still at that carcass trying to decide whether you-know-who was a clone and who were his clones and whatnot.

The first impressions were good. Force Awakens seemed great. But when you look under the hood, it fell apart right in the premise - he reset everything to the same situation as in the start of New Hope and TROS finished off Return Of The Jedi's legacy - poetically - with the first two words of it's opening scroll by announcing the return of you-know-who. The dead speak, my ass.

Someone who knows Star Trek can probably better describe where he went wrong there.

Villeneuve will likely be spectacular. I haven't been a fan of his direction of his actors, but I'll probably get through even if their acting is misguided, because I like most of them. And at the very least, Bautista's ambition to prove himself as a serious actor will liven the movie enough. As long as he doesn't re-do dramatic *take-off-my-glasses*\-routine. Bruno Kanz did that once and he did it perfectly, god bless his soul.",scifi,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/fufppn/dune_as_a_fan_of_dune_i_am_grateful_jj_abrams_is/,86l42280036l8346,2020-04-03 16:21:44,90,18,5.0,NA,NA,0

The first book in particular is just absolute magic, so much joke density, so much happening, and the underlying message / philosophy is just so good. 

Never hurts to be reminded that maybe we should all take it a little less seriously (and by it, I mean life, the universe, and everything).

What were your favorite books in the series? 1 and 4 for me (HGTTG and So Long and Thanks for All the Fish).

qqavtz,top,"Dune, the most convoluted (and brilliant) justification for hand-to-hand combat in a sci-fi setting","MINOR SPOILERS FOR DUNE BOOKS (only worldbuilding, no story)

So for those who don't know, Dune universe is about a bunch of noble aristocratic houses, in a spacefaring interstellar empire, fighting among themselves, often for the control of a dessert planet Arrakis. Now, the story is awesome and all, one of the greatest works ever written and all that...blah blah bla......

But here I am to illuminate your day with HOW they fight. Most of the time....they fight with swords. Yes, an interstellar empire, with FTL travel capabilities...and the people mostly cut each other with sharp metal sticks.

Now why? Obviously melee combat is cool as F#%K, and Frank Herbert had storytelling and philisophy reasons for wanting to make it that way. But I hear you: that's a justification for the uneducated masses, we're better than that, we're here for the IN-UNIVERSE explanation! I am glad you asked:

PART 0 - NO ROBOTS

Now, before we even get to how people fight, it needs to be said that it is always people fighting. Flesh and bone. There are no robots or artificial intelligence in the imperium, in fact there is nothing as advanced as even a simple calculator. No drones, no computers, no guided missiles, no smartphones. In-universe, long ago robots and AI did exist, until there was...wait for it: an uprising. A shocker I know. But here's the first twist: it wasn't the AI rebelling against humans, its was humans rebelling against other humans who used AI and robots to control the rest of mankind. You see humanity was using AI so much, it became depedent on it, using it as a crutch, and human kind began to stagnate as robots took care of all our needs. And so the people rebelled, overthrew their opressors and destoryed all the advanced computing technology. They agreed to never create AI again and from then on to work on improving the humankind itself, with the commandement being encoded in religious scripture as: ""Thou shall not make a machine in the likeness of the human mind"" and being punishable by death, no exceptions, no excuses.

PART 1 - THE SHIELDS

So now that we have established the combat is always man-on-man, let's begin with the shields. Like many other sci-fi, Dune has energy shields. They utilize something called the ""Holtzman Effect"", that has something to do with how particles interact on subatomic scale. This effect is the basis for most of their advanced technology, including their FTL drives, the suspensors that allow hovercraft and people to levitate, and yes energy shields. These shields can be quite small and personal shields are a common occurence. The energy field stops any incoming projectile and repuls it with an equal force. And just like that, any ranged projectile weapons have been made utterly useless. When out in the open, any soldier or noblesman only need to have his shield on and they are invulnerable to ranged attacks.

But there is a problem: Since the shield would also repell any air particles it needs to be configured in such a way as to allow slow-moving objects to pass through, otherwise the wearer would quickly suffocate. Therefore, no projectile weapons can hurt you, but you are left vulnerable to melee attacks, such as swords and daggers. And going back to point #0 it will indeed be human who attacks you, since there are no sneaky robots or slow guided flying drones around.

PART 2 - ENERGY WEAPONS

Okay, thats all good and fun, but surely being so advanced they have energy/beam weapons in this universe right? So they can just shoot at the shield until it is overwhelmed and it collapses, just like in Star Wars or Trek? Well good thinking, but no. They do indeed have ""lasguns"" in the imperium. And they are powerful, able to cut through nearly anything and vaporize humans in seconds. However....when a lasgun beam hits the surface of the energy shield, thanks to the Holztman effect, a nuclear reaction occurs which results in the death of both the wearer and the shooter. Yes you heard that right. If you shoot a laser at a Holtzman energy shield, it exploded like a small nuke, killing everyone in the area.

As you can imagine, this puts both the wearer and attacker at a CONSIDERABLE risk. Nearly every person of importance wears an energy shield on them all of the time, and have it turned on every time they're out in public. Therefore it becomes.....unreasonable to risk death by nuclear fire when shooting at your target. For this reason, although not outlawed, lasguns are use sparringly across the imperium, usually on non-human targets.

PART 3 - NUKES

Alright, but now the keen readers might get the idea: if a lasgun hitting a Holtzman shiled creates a nuclear explosion, couldn't they simply put both in a box, with a timer, and deploy them as nuclear bombs agaisnt each others planets? Well yes....but actually no. You see all the great houses do indeed stock up on nuclear weapons. But the Great Convention prohibits anyone from using ""atomics"" on other human beings. If one of the great Houses used their atomic weapons, all the rest would unite against them and eliminate them, no mercy, no exceptions. And so the feudal families stock up, waiting on a chance that humanity ever needs nuclear weapons against any potential aliens.

As you can imagine, this also makes any spaceship-to-spaceship combat impossible. Any projectile weapons like railguns, unguided rockets, or machine guns just ricochet of the spacecraft's Holtzman shields. And any use of lasguns would cause a nuclear explosion, which would bring all the other great houses unified against you. Again, making a man-on-man hand-to-hand combat the only possibility for warfare.

PART 4 - ASSASSINATION

Okay, so an empire of feudal aristocratic houses, whose armies fight each other with swords, just like in the medieval times. And those who read history know there is only one thing feudal houses are more fond of than fabulous feasts and large-scale warfare, thats right! Political assassination! And indeed keen reader, there is political assassination within the Dune universe, and a lot of it. In fact, the is so much assassination happening that every child of every great noble house is trained in melee combat and defensive tactics from an early age. Sparring lessons, hand-to-hand martial arts, all that makes them into an even better melee/sword combatant.

Oh and in case you're so abominable as to resort to poison, all the great houses can afford to have something called ""poison snoopers"", that set off alarm when they detect a poison in food or drink.



TLDR: So we have a sci-fi setting with no robots, energy shields that only let through slow-moving objects, any laser weapons would result in a nuclear explosion when hitting said shield killing both the shooter and the wearer, and using nuclear weapons will bring a swift death at the hands of the other great houses. Leaving the only option for warfare: melee combat with sharp steel sticks.

Man, I sure am glad napalm and flamethrowers are not a thing.

EDIT: For all of those people who say ""just send a suicide bomber with a shield and lasgun"", that's the point of the great convention. If they use nukes, they are as good as dead. And in this universe truthsayers exist so it could always be traced back to the culprit. If an Atreides army gets nuked to death, the emperor only needs to summon the baron Harkonnen and have a reverend mother ask him. The Baron is evil but he wouldn't risk the extermination of his entire bloodline/planet",scifi,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/qqavtz/dune_the_most_convoluted_and_brilliant/,Majestic_Bierd,2021-11-09 14:11:22,99,14,7.071428571428571,NA,NA,0

72d2vb,top,Like Star Trek? You owe it to yourself to give The Orville the 3 episode test.,"I was skeptical when I saw so many people defending The Orville. I'm not much for comedy in my scifi - Truth be told I'm usually not a fan of Seth McFarlanes works at all.

Yet I did the three episode test, watching and withholding judgement for three episodes, much as I would allow a book three chapters to grab me.

And I'm glad that I did. While the first episode was mostly a whiff for me, its second episode improved, and made some not so subtle jabs at humanity in its current position.

Then the third episode, and I can honestly say I'm eagerly awaiting what comes next. There is something... roddenberry esque about the whole thing, presenting a moral quandary, and then resolving it how they did. [spoiler](/s ""Honestly, the whole 'species did what it was going to do anyway' thing, is something only shown in Star Trek... usually the 'heroes' always win, but not here."")

vp8f7c,top,I'm watching Firefly for the first time and it is AMAZING!,"Over the past two decades, I've heard many times about how awesome Firefly is and how it is a must-watch. I recently got a Hulu subscription and finally got around watching it now, 20 years(!!) after the show first aired. AND I'M LOVING IT!

I can't believe this show holds up on its own even today. I'm loving everything about it- the plotline, the characters, the pace, the snarky humor... It is just such a fun and engaging show! Once I finish the 14 episodes, I plan on watching the sequel movie, Serenity, next.

I'm reading up more about why this show ran for only one season on TV and it appears that FOX Network bungled the episode viewing order causing a rapid drop in early viewership. Honestly, that's a gorram shame. I'm watching the episodes in the order they were meant to be watched, and it has been shiny so far!

Anyway,.. those of you who haven't yet watched Firefly, go watch it now. I highly recommend this show!

Today Amazon took complete control of The Expanse's worldwide streaming rights, and all current episodes of the show are free to stream for anyone with a Prime membership in 200+ countries. Amazon rescued the show from cancellation by SyFy last summer.

Season 4 also just wrapped filming and should air later this year, probably summer or fall.

Here are some videos that explain the world and backstory for those who haven't seen the show before

>I have seen reddit do some incredible things before, and I know it would mean so much to his family if we could help provide them some stability during this difficult time so that they can properly grieve, instead of worry about how they'll pay for his funeral.

>I am in contact with his sister and father and giving them daily updates. I have also gotten this thread approved by the other mods of /r/BreakingBad. Several of his other friends are in this thread commenting, along with helping me raise money for this campaign.

>Although the family doesn't have an estimate from the funeral home yet (they will tomorrow), I have called around to several funeral homes in Jarod's city and 9000 seems to be the average all-inclusive price for a memorial service and cremation burial. Not sure which route the family is going to take, but 9000 should at make a big dent in the cost if they choose to opt-out of cremation. I think 6000 is as bare-bones as it could get. Any extra money (if we meet the goal) can pay for their indirect expenses such as taking off of work, traveling, food, etc.

>Several of us have already begun reaching out to Breaking Bad actors that he collaborated with for AMAs on /r/BreakingBad. Rick, a mutual friend of ours, is already talking to ""Combo"" Rodney Rush and we're hoping to contact as many cast members as possible. If anybody has any contacts, please get them on board.

>I am hoping that /r/BreakingBad might be interested in helping to raise money as well to help his family with this unexpected financial burden.

>Any money raised (even if we don't reach the goal) will go right to his father for funeral-related expenses.

At the time I'm writing this, a little over One Thousand dollars has been raised.   If you are in a position to donate, please consider doing so.  But even if you aren't, feel free to join the current discussions and share memories and thoughts.   

I know that I will miss him a lot.

It's an epic ending for Wolverine and the X-Men. After 14 years in the role, Hugh Jackman somehow didn't get an Oscar from this masterpiece.

I love that Logan didn't focus on big battles of hundreds of superheroes punching each other in a big field. Instead, it focused on family. It's an intimate movie. It's a sad goodbye.

hpwc2p,top,District 9 theory - The Prawn's real purpose.,"This contains spoilers for District 9.

On its surface, District 9 is a story about racial oppression.  The concept is based on the story of the real [District 6](https://www.newsweek.com/real-district-9-cape-towns-district-six-78939).

But I think it is worth taking a closer look at the Prawns and their reasons for coming to Earth.

Let's begin with a few facts:  

The aliens are called Prawns because ""they look like prawns"", but there's another reason humans used that name.  The aliens never told humans the name of their species.  In fact, the aliens don't tell humans anything about their origins.  We'll get back to that later.

It's established that all of the Prawns on the ship are a combination of worker and warrior caste.  They are strong and fast but ultimately lack any motivation of their own.  Without a leader, they become directionless.  And on this ship, the leader died.

The aliens came with a massive store of weapons.  We see half a dozen types of energy weapons as well as a combat mech that is more than a match for anything the humans throw at it.  (It is only defeated because Wikus has no training in how to operate it, and doesn't use it to its full potential.)  And consider that this arsenal is just the items that are smuggled down from the ship to District 9.  The ship must have a massive armory.

The Prawn technology contains biological sensors, so that it will only work for Prawns.  I'll go one step further, and suggest that some of the technology will only work for specific classes of Prawn, or will only work when activated remotely.  We see that with the mech, which doesn't reach full potential until Christopher Johnson activates the mothership's systems.

When humans break into the ship, they cut through 6 feet of wall to get to into the hold where the Prauns are.  I'll say that again, six feet of wall trapped the Prauns inside their own ship.

And lastly there's the ""fluid"" that Christopher Johnson was gathering.  On the surface it seems harmless enough, it's just something that allows the Prawn technology to operate.  But look at what happens when Wikus is exposed to it.  This harmless fluid can take a species that it's never encountered before and turn it into a Prawn.

When you look at all of this together, it becomes clear that the ship was a slaver.  The aliens locked in the hold weren't even Prawns originally.  They were a third species that the real Prawns had attacked, captured, and turned into more Prawn workers via the fluid.  Given their general confusion, naivety, and inability to help themselves, it's likely that they were an extremely primitive species before they were converted.  This is why they couldn't control the ship.  And this is why they did not have any information about the Prawns.

The ship was on course for Johannesburg, South Africa to capture more slaves.  Johannesburg was a perfect target.  It's a populated city at the southern end of the most undeveloped continent on the planet (excluding Antarctica).  It is in the opposite hemisphere from a majority of industrialized human civilization.  The aliens could have raided the city for slaves and been gone before humans had time to organize a response.

Luckily for humanity, the leader of this ship died enroute.  The ship's autopilot parked it over Johannesburg.  Without a leader to direct the ship, it sat there for months.  The Prawn slaves were locked in the hold, slowly starving.

In the movie we see two Prawns in detail, Christopher Johnson and his child.  These two seem to be exceptions to the norm.  Christopher is motivated and educated beyond the level of other Prawns, and is working to get the command module repaired so that he can go for help.  And his child is even more active, intelligent, and motivated.

I think that Christopher was an intermediate caste, the equivalent of a General.  Rather than being a slave who was converted by the fluid, he was a pureblood Prawn.  As a General, Christopher would have limited control over the ship's technology.  He could activate weapons, and could maneuver the ship locally (a useful skill during a surface operation) but he could not make it break orbit or travel between solar systems.  Only a Leader could do that.

When a bee hive needs a new queen, they feed royal jelly to a developing larvae, and it becomes a queen.  Christopher was the last survivor of the ship's old leadership.  He hid the command module by flying it down to District 9 and commanding worker Prawns to bury it under his shack.  And then he began breeding a new Leader, his son.  Only his son could fly the mothership home.

With all of the weapons at their disposal, why did the aliens allow themselves to be herded into District 9?  Christopher could have activated the alien weaponry at any time and lead a revolution that would have freed the residents of District 9.  The simple answer is that he didn't care.  They were just slaves to him, and only useful to provide labor and to help him blend in and hide from humans.  His goal wasn't to get every Prawn off of the planet.  His only goal was to protect his son until he was mature enough to operate the mothership and take them both home.

And he said that he would be back in 3 years.  We should hope that he was lying to placate Wikus.  If he really is planning on coming back to our undefended, overpopulated planet, he'll be bringing a fleet of slave ships.",scifi,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/hpwc2p/district_9_theory_the_prawns_real_purpose/,MyMomSaysIAmCool,2020-07-12 11:38:52,45,8,5.625,NA,NA,0

Infinite diversity in infinite combinations.

Beings of light, lizard people, insectoid Martians, slug/humanoid in a mutually beneficial relationship, they’re all just part of the universe’s wonders, with the same flaws and virtues as humanity.

s5eou9,top,Why you really should watch the Netflix TV show DARK,"There is a r/Dark subreddit but the show is little-known and deserves a wider audience. Apologies if a TV show recommendation isn't allowed here.

EDIT: it seems more people than I ever believed possible know about the show. I'm an old man now and this pleases my heart so much!

So ... trying to explain this show without spoilers will be tricky but let's give it a go. Firstly, let's talk about what it isn't. It's not English: it's a German show that you can watch either dubbed or with subtitles. Despite the fact that it starts with a missing boy, it's also not the German version of Stranger Things. And it's not massively sci-fi focused, apart from the show's main plot device, although I'm sure you will adore how Schrodinger's Cat and the Higgs-Boson particle are vital elements of the story.

So what is it? Well, it's 26 episodes of 45 minutes each, spread over 3 series. There is a proper conclusion to the narrative. Each series increases the complexity of the plot until you simply cannot see how it can end satisfactorily. Thankfully though, it's also not Game Of Thrones, and the conclusion is immensely rewarding.

It's the story of four families living in a small south German town called Winden. In 2019 a boy goes missing and an active search is underway. The disappearance reminds older residents of a similar missing boy, a case that happened precisely 33 years before. Then, another boy goes missing in 2019 and the brown smelly stuff really hits the revolving metal object.

Why am I recommending this? Firstly, the plotting over the 3 series is superb in that it is difficult to see any holes or inconsistencies in what is undoubtedly the most complex narrative I've watched for some time. (Thankfully there is an official website that enables you to enter your current episode so that you can recap on key plot points without spoilers.) The casting is unbelievable, but I can't say more about that without giving away spoilers. The soundtrack is utterly brilliant too. I was hooked from the first episode but S1E6 is when my jaw hit the floor and I started binging it.

Literally everyone I know who has watched S1E1 has loved it. The battle I've had is in convincing people to watch a German sci-fi show in the first place. I've bribed, blackmailed and coerced my friends into giving it a go and after seeing the show, they've all agreed there's nothing like it out there. One warning: you cannot watch this whilst distracted. It requires your full attention at all times. It demands and expects an adult audience who have a reasonable attention span and can understand what's going on without tons of exposition.

Please try it. I hope you enjoy it, and I'm pretty sure you will!",scifi,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/s5eou9/why_you_really_should_watch_the_netflix_tv_show/,UncleArthur,2022-01-16 10:56:06,52,10,5.2,NA,NA,0

ha8vo,top,See you later Syfy...,"Well I just watched the last episode of Stargate Universe and I can now safely say I will never turn on the Syfy channel again.  I'd like to thank the people at Syfy...no no I wouldn't.  

I'd like to thank the people at SciFi, my all time favorite American TV station.  SciFi, you had the best original and syndicated programming around and you really knew your audience.  You found a niche, you did a great job, and things were good.

SyFy?  Well what can I say besides that our relationship has been abusive, deceptive, miserable, and all around a fucking horrible experience.  Thanks for cancelling, mothballing, and ruining the only things I liked on television.  Thanks for taking a small  but popular channel full of things that your core audience loved and removing them from your programming.  Thanks for changing out  Stargate for WWE.  There is nothing that gets my science fiction juices flowing like a bunch of roided-up men in tights touching each other...that was just great.  Thanks for showing Ghost Hunters 4 hours a day - that show is fucking awesome and so much better written then the crap from Roddenberry, Whedon, Rob Cooper and Brad Wright, or any of other myriad of talented people you ignore.  Thanks for showing Scare Tactics instead of ... I hate you.  Oh and Ghost Hunters International?  Really...really?  Cause um, are you fucking kidding me? Thanks for making it impossible to catch an episode of your show online until it is 5 weeks old.  Have you heard of Hulu?  Google it.  

I can't wait until you are the CW of television...who am I kidding, at least CW came from UPN who ran Star Trek Voyager to an organized, and well planned 7 seasons.  You can't keep a show in the same fucking time slot for 5 weeks in a row.  

TL:DR -- Sci Fi thanks for the memories, SyFY - let me know when you have the estate sale.

Most shows these days tend to throw science out the window. Maybe it’s to show more intense action, or maybe they don’t know any better; I’m not sure why and there are probably multiple seasons. And that’s OK too, but in a balanced dose. I’m super excited to see Moonfall in a month despite the fact that I know it’s not going to be realistic. But for every Moonfall, I wish there was an Epanse – an IP that promoted science by showing how true-to-our-reality physics can be just as compelling if not more so than a show that ignores science. 

I recently suffered through Ivasion on Apple, which ignored science to the point of an astronaut shown swimming through space. Sometimes it does look cool, but often times it’s believable enough to those that don’t know about it yet, like a kid learning about space. People are impressionable, especially about topics they haven’t learned about yet. Keep the fantasy, fantasy. There are already too many people believing that you can swim and hear screams in space, and not enough people taking science and reality seriously.

[Points of Origin, by E. S. Fein](https://www.amazon.com/Points-Origin-S-Fein-ebook/dp/B07CXV6VW6/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

""***Amero wakes from an eerily familiar dream in an unfamiliar bed.***

***Within hours, he is forced onto an experimental craft and jettisoned across the galaxy alongside a mysterious, potentially homicidal man named Hann.***

***Finding themselves in a strange yet familiar spacetime, the men are told by suspicious entities to hunt for Points, strange objects no larger than one's thumb, which are spread across the cosmos by unknown means.***

***The purpose of the hunt is unknown. The purpose of the Points is unknown.***

***All Amero wants is to return to his dead-end life. All Hann wants is to hunt down and destroy those responsible for his predicament.***

***It will take a journey to the end of time itself and beyond the boundaries of every universe to know the truth--to witness the light behind the veil...for better or worse.""***

Here's some of my favorite reviews for the book as well:

**""A hyperdimensional transhumanist space opera thriller--that's my best attempt at categorizing this peacock of literary genres that's worth every minute of reading. The story begins on a near-future Earth run by the New Covenant, a religion/global hegemony which has rewritten the Bible and conquered nearly every continent, and it ends somewhere beyond hyperspace,beyond causality itself, beyond...well, I don't want to spoil the journey. All I can say is wow! E. S. Fein seamlessly blends original ideas and traditional sci-fi archetypes with Eastern philosophy and playful, yet complex ontological theories surrounding the nature of existence. All the while, the characters, which include sentient software and a hyperdimensional wizard, will leave you in a daze of never wanting to leave the strange universe E. S. Fein displaces you in. One of my favorite books of the year--I can't wait for E. S. Fein to write more!""**

**""This book is hard enough to interest core sci-fi fanbase while soft enough and with enough character development to interest the more casual reader. It's a great merger of philosophy, science, and drama that draws heavily from the eastern mystic heritage. The climax of the inter-personal drama crept up on me, so much that I didn't even realize it was there until a short while afterwards. At it's core, it amounts to a thought experiment on what could occur given the potentiality of our universe, even a possibility of what our reality is exactly. It had me thinking about it and wishing I could be back home to read it during the day. It's cheap, interesting, and relatively fast paced so you could breeze through it if you so desire. Recommended""**

7o2cfe,top,I think the critics were extremely and unjustly harsh on Bright (2017),"It wasn’t bad at all. Not amazing, but nowhere near close to justifying the unadulterated attack it’s been getting from critics. 
For me, Bright was something I call a ‘fluff’ movie. These are the kind of films you sit back, kick your feet up, don’t take things too seriously and if you enjoy yourself, well then great. Other examples include Red Heat and Supercop. 

I remember laughing at the cop banter, being engaged with Jakoby’s internal struggle and his journey of ultimately finding self-fulfilment. I remember loving the world that was built and wanting to see more. It honestly was a decent film that did its job. I can see why critics didn’t like it, but not why they actively hated it.

Of course, it has its downsides. The action, for example, is poorly lit and awkwardly shot. But so have been the action scenes from various blockbusters from this year that were critically acclaimed. Is there a bias against Netflix from critics? I don’t know.

Anyway, as a fan of gritty cop movies, 80’s action movies, and fantastical sci fi adventures, I can safely say I enjoyed Bright very much, and it serves as yet another example as to why as film fans we should judge a film ourselves and not let others do it for us. By the way, I also did a non-spoiler review for it here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0LifZNIzS0) if you’re interested.

Looking forward to the announced sequel.
